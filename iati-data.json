The objective of GAVI support for Health Systems Strengthening (HSS) is to address system bottlenecks to achieve better immunisation outcomes, including coverage and equity. As such, it is necessary for applications for HSS support by countries to be based on a strong bottleneck and gap analysis, and present a clear results chain demonstrating the link between proposed activities and improved immunisation outcomes.

The pentavalent vaccine, administered in a three-dose schedule, offers protection against five diseases: diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP), heptatitis B and Haemophilius influenzae type b. Until 2013, GAVI has helped to introduce the pentavalent in 70 of the 73 GAVI-eligible countries, with the aim of reaching all 73 by the end of 2014.

        "description": "The project aims at improving the capacity of public sector health and education institutions to provide quality services with special focus on vulnerable groups: women children and youth through skills and knowledge transfer by the Somali diaspora. The ov\nerall objective of the project is to contribute to stabilization in South Central Somalia and Puntland through increasing access to basic services (health and education) and creating employment opportunities for the youth including women. In addition young\n Somalis will be placed in internship positions under the supervision of the diaspora experts at relevant institutions. The project trains health and education sector professionals to produce quality public services in health and education and to administe\nr the resources of the sectors. The trainers are diaspora experts especially Finnish diaspora who work and share their expertise in the sectors.The Mid-Term Evaluation which was finalized in August 2018 showed that results have been gained in both health a\nnd education sectors. For example the intake of patients at Yardimeli Hospital in Mogadishu has increased significantly in a short period of time from around 800 patients in July 2017 to around 4000 in March 2018. Moreover the number of assisted births inc\nreased substantially. The diaspora experts placed at the Ministry of Education were successful in supporting the organizational reform and writing key strategic planning documents for the sector. According to the Mid-Term Evaluation the project was very re\nlevant in filling the gaps and specialized needs in the institutions. According to all participants both local and the diaspora the project was successful in producing sustainable results in skills and knowledge. The implementing partner is the Internation\nal Organisation for Migration (IOM). From 2015 to 2019 Finland has supported the project with 4 420 000 EUR. From 2019 to 2021 the total budget for the second phase funded by Finland is 5 400 000 EUR. The budget is disbursed as follows: 1 MEUR in 2019; 24 \nMEUR in 2020; 2 MEUR in 2021.",

The additional funding supports the Somaliland Ministry of Health efforts to combat the COVID-19 pandemic health consequences\n for 3 months. To achieve this the project supports the capacity of public sector institutions to provide quality health services. Three outputs have been defined:1.) Local health professionals have skills/capacity to deliver quality health services2.) Loc\nal health training institutions have improved competence and ability to train local health professionals 3.) Ministry of Health has increased capacity to steer manage and coordinate the health sector The Somali diaspora experts particularly the Finnish Som\nali diaspora experts are the actors in the capacity building efforts. They train the local health professionals and participate in developing strategies plans standards and curricula for health sector. Particular attention is given to women's and child hea\nlth. In the long term the project is expected to contribute to better health outcomes for Somaliland population and especially the health outcomes for women and children.The first Finnish funded MIDA project was initiated already in 2008. The project has b\neen evaluated twice and the findings suggest that the project has significantly strengthened public health institutions? ability to provide quality services in Somaliland. The findings and recommendations of evaluations have been duly notified in the plann\ning of the Finnsom IV phase: For example the project now focuses on the more remote regions in Somaliland where service provision is poorer than in the capital Hargeisa. Similarly following the recommendations the length of the assignments of diaspora expe\nrts has been increased for Phase IV.To support the implementation of the project the National Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) also implements tailored trainings for the Ministry of Health.The duration of the Phase IV is four years from March 2017 un\ntil August 2020. The budget for the project is 4 300 000 Euros. Somalia is considered an LDC country.",

        "description": "The Daryeel Mobile Health Clinic ?project aims at providing preventive and basic health care services to rural areas outside of Afmadow town in Jubaland Somalia. The project is executed by the Finland-Somalia Association (FSA) with partner NGO SAHDA and th\ne Jubaland Ministry of Health. The project is a continuation of the Maternal and Child Health Services Clinic ?project that the FSA has ran since 2011 in Afmadow town. Based on an agreement with the Jubaland Ministry of Health the FSA has been asked to swi\ntch its foces to more remote villages through a mobile clinic. The mobile clinic is to start its operations in 2018 depending on permission from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Finland. With this application the project plan is to continue the Mobile He\nalth Clinic through 2019-2020 a total of three years.The main development problem that the project aims to solve is the poor access to preventive and basic health care in the Afmadow area in Jubaland Somalia. The project aims to take health services close \nto remote communities where it is difficult to get access to basic healthcare and where travelling is a challenge. By curing and providing basic health services in remote locations the project contrib-utes to creating a healthier community and society with\n people who are able to work for their own livelihoods. In this context the project contributes significantly to achieving the UN?s Sustainable Development Goals. The development impact that the project strives for is to increase the wellbeing of the commu\nnities in the project area and to decrease the number of diseases and illnesses.The mobile clinic concept includes three core outputs:1. Supporting existing healthcare by providing health services in suburbs nearby villages and towns2. Providing supportive\n services in first aid family reproductive services and interventions reducing infectious diseases in the target villages3. Reducing travelling for health services from the towns as well as building the competence of the local community in health particula\nrly by giving tools and knowledge to local midwives.",

        "description": "The project is founded on PSR's previous projects in Somalia which have developed new strategies to tackle tuberculosis (TB) ? especially in community and private sector engagement. A special focus will be placed on women and vulnerable community members: \ndisabled persons IDPs and prisoners. Tuberculosis is a central health problem in Somalia. The increase of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a global threat ? fighting against MDR-TB in Somalia benefits all countries. Another central problem is \nthe low treatment coverage rate of about 37% leaving far too many cases untreated further transmitting tuberculosis to others. The impact targets of the project are to: a) tackle multi-drug resistant tuberculosis; and b) increase the tuberculosis case dete\nction rate. The long-term objective of the project is to contribute to the reduction of the tuberculosis burden in Somalia with the following means:1. Increase the access of women and vulnerable groups to TB services (such as disabled personsIDPs and priso\nners)2. Increase TB referrals from the private sector3. Improve the quality of TB treatment in both the public and private sector4. Improve the quality of TB laboratory work.The central partners of the project are the National Tuberculosis Programmes of So\nmaliland and Somalia. PSR has a central role in developing the national tuberculosis diagnostic infrastructure in Somalia. The project will support the National TB Reference Laboratories in Somaliland and South-Central Somalia as well as will treatment of \ntuberculosis patients in 3 clinics in Hargeisa and Mogadishu. These clinics will develop innovative community public and private sector engagement models to increase case detection improve treatment quality and to increase public awareness and decrease sti\ngma/discrimination. The clinics will also provide HIV services and nutritional support for malnourished patients (with WFP).Together with the local administration the tuberculosis clinics will be transformed into health centers providing specialized tuberc\nulosis services by the end of 2022 to support integration with basic health services and sustainability after the project has ended.",

The Clinic provides maternal healthcare for thousands of women and treats about 20 000 outpatients annually. Th\ne Clinic is the only one in the area operating free of cost and open 24/7. In addition to maternal health services the project aims to increase the awareness of health-related issues in the local community such as FGM HIV/AIDS provide support for the victi\nms of gender-based violence through counseling and organize training to traditional birth attendants. Long-term goal of the project is to improve women's health in Afgoye and ensure women's access to quality maternal healthcare. Main beneficiaries of the p\nroject are the women receiving maternal healthcare and counseling at the Clinic and their children. Furthermore all the outpatients receiving care at the Clinic and people participating to the awareness raising are beneficiaries of the project. This includ\nes vulnerable groups such as IDPs and disabled women. The results of the previous project phases show that the Clinic is providing vital source of quality care both to expectant mothers and other members of the community. Raising awareness about health has\n been successful and majority of pregnant women and mothers treated at the Clinic report negative attitude towards FGM.

Greater attention will be given to the inclusion of the marginalized and women. The programme aims to achieve three outcomes: i) Outcome 1: Policy, legal and regulatory frameworks on local governance finalized: - Policy and legislative frameworks for functional, fiscal and administrative decentralization clarify the role of local governments and their relationship to federal/central and state governments, with a view to attaining improved service delivery and stability. ii) Outcome 2: Local governments\u2019 have the capacity to deliver equitable and sustainable services, promote economic development and peace:- Building on the successes and lessons from previous phases, JPLG will consolidate, harmonize and systematize, its capacity enhancement approaches \u2013 bearing in mind the different contexts under which it operates. In Somaliland, the focus will be to empower Local Government Institute (LGIs) as drivers of capacity building initiatives. In Puntland, and the new states the programme will work with the Ministries of Interior and other partner ministries to streamline capacity development initiatives while, putting in place mechanisms to operationalise the recently approved National Local Government Capacity Development Policy (see Annex 3). It will focus on supporting capacity development beyond JPLG districts and apply capacity development lessons from Puntland to boost the new FMSs and BRA. In the new federal member states, the program will build local governments\u2019 capacity to deliver equitable services, deepen stabilization and contribute to economic recovery. iii) Outcome 3: Local governments demonstrate improved engagement of citizens, with an emphasis on women and marginalized groups:-The aim of JPLG III is to promote citizen engagement, gender equity and social inclusion, through efforts to strengthen key local governance policies, structures and processes. Barriers to women\u2019s advancement in public administration, denial of opportunities for citizens, particularly traditionally marginalized individuals and groups, to take part in, and benefit from, local decision-making, all serve to undermine the principles of equal opportunity and social justice that are the bedrock of inclusive development and democratic governance \u2013 while retaining a driver of conflict.",

        "title": "Desert Locusts Joint Response - Lead",
        "description": "The current locust crisis in the Horn of Africa is the worst outbreak of locusts in over 25 years in Ethiopia and Somalia and the worst observed in over 70 years in Kenya. The situation rapidly deteriorated in January 2020 as weather conditions have been unusually conducive to the spread of the pest. These conditions will allow breeding until June 2020 and could lead to 500 times more locusts, with the formation of large numbers of swarms. Desert locusts are expected to continue to breed and spread during the coming months. Given their life cycle, the March-April start of the long rains, coinciding with a regeneration of rangeland and the start of planting activities, will enable a new wave of breeding and further spread of the pest. Desert locusts have already reached northern Uganda, and looking forward, the infestation could: 1) spread further into the Rift Valley (especially in Ethiopia), as well as to South Sudan, 2) affect the 2020 main and secondary staple cropping seasons, and 3) continue to affect rangeland across the region. The desert locust is considered the most destructive migratory pest in the world as it is highly mobile and feeds on large quantities of any kind of green vegetation, including crops, pasture and fodder. A typical swarm can be made up of 150 million locusts per square kilometre and is carried on the wind, up to 150 km in one day. Even a very small, 1 km2 locust swarm (approx. 40 million desert locusts) can eat the same amount of food in one day as about 35 000 people. This can be especially devastating in areas where food security is poor and, where every gram of food produced counts towards minimizing gaps in a family\u2019s food consumption. Currently, the region faces widespread food insecurity. In Ethiopia, an estimated 8.5 million people are severely food insecure, Phase 3 and above, according to IPC between February and June 2020. In Somalia, from February to September 2020, the population in IPC Phases 3 (Crisis) and 4 (Emergency) is expected to rise by 40 percent, from 1.1 million to 1.6 million people. Drivers of this food insecurity include climate shocks, conflict, and macroeconomic crises. Ethiopia has been responding to the current swarm invasions since July 2019. To date, hopper bands have covered more than 429 km\u00b2 of the country. Two generations of breeding have caused large numbers of swarms to form and move to Kenya and Somalia. In January 2020, the swarms were also seen moving towards the Rift Valley in Ethiopia and Kenya\u2019s breadbasket. This would pose a serious threat, especially as Ethiopia already has an estimated 8.5 million people facing severe food insecurity. In Somalia, where 6.7 million people are now regarded as acutely food insecure (IPC Phase 2 and above), swarms bred in the north of the country and have moved mainly to central and southern regions. The pest is affecting pasture and threatening staple food crops in rural areas. Insecurity and a lack of national capacity have hampered control operations. The Somalia Food Security Cluster showed their findings in a presentation; the number of people affected was shown as over 2.5 million (21% of Somalia\u2019s population) and especially pastoralist, agro-pastoralist, riverine and IDPs are affected. COVID-19 In light of the global pandemic of COVID-19, on 25 March 2020, the United Nations launched a USD 2 billion Global Humanitarian Response Plan (GHRP). On 3 February, WHO also launched a Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan (SPRP). The following responses, corresponding with a locust crisis response, must be accelerated or scaled up to achieve Strategic Priorities 2 and 3 of the Covid-19 HRP: - Food and nutrition assistance as well as rural livelihood support to food-insecure and malnourished people vulnerable to the infection particularly in countries experiencing food crises. - Scale-up of social assistance systems, and cash transfer programmes with complementary livelihood assistance (including adaptations for remote digital trade/marketing), particularly for rural crop and livestock workers and producers, small/medium businesses, refugees, IDPs, migrants and host populations, and other food-insecure population groups. The Somalia section of the Covid-19 HRP mentions under the most affected and at-risk population groups that the pandemic could also heavily impact vulnerable communities living in areas dealing with food insecurity and desert locusts, while Ethiopia section mentions that COVID-19 response will undermine efforts to combat desert locust infestations. While people\u2019s lives are threatened by the COVID-19 outbreak, the upcoming two agricultural production seasons are threatened by desert locust infestations. The number of COVID-19 cases reported in both Somalia (237) and Ethiopia (111) as of 20-04-2020 is still relatively low (also due to underreporting). Yet, the countries follow government restrictions and the response is designed with integrated COVID-10 measures.",

        "description": "EGEP-T aims to increase girls\u2019 learning in numeracy, literacy and life skills, whilst supporting them through key transition points in education and beyond to improved life opportunities. The project will also be developing community and institutional capacity to ensure support to girls\u2019 education is sustained in the longer term. EGEP saw significant progress regarding community members\u2019 expectations of girls about girls\u2019 education between baseline and midline. General support for girls\u2019 education increased by 27% across community members surveyed and the percentage of caregivers stating gender to be an important factor determining whether a child should go to school declined from 54% to 9%. Respondents frequently noted that community members themselves are engaging in awareness-raising activities. School enrolment increased by 20% and attendance increased by 5%, which suggests this positive shift in attitudes has led to positive results in school. Learning levels increased, however, they did not reach the intended targets. 37% of girls who enter secondary school have dropped out by Form 4. A contributing factor behind these less positive trends appears to be that the aspirations of caregivers and communities for girls\u2019 education can be at odds with the considerable expectations placed on girls in terms of traditionally assigned gender roles. EGEP conducted 70 FGDs with girls, asking them what the most critical challenges were that lead to girls\u2019 decreased participation in school in later grades: after economic factors, the most common response was early marriage, and the third most common response was household chores. Additionally, girls are often expected to prioritise care of siblings or contribution to household income over schooling and homework. These expectations intensify as the girl reaches adolescence. Furthermore, within the school, girls are not necessarily expected to achieve at the same level as boys, to hold leadership positions, and to complete the full education cycle. The table below provides examples of severely marginalised groups of girls the project will target, the current expectations for these groups and how they differ from what the project intends to achieve:",

The contribution aims to help strengthen the Somali health sector by supporting primary health care at local level. By strengthening the capacity of local authorities in governance and decision making regarding health issues, increasing access and quality of services, and strengthening the empowerment and resilience of the population, this effort is considered to contribute to improving community health. In addition, the main focus of this contribution lies on maternity, neonatal and child health in order to help strengthen the health of women and children and their potential for survival.\n\nSince 2012, Sida has supported the Somali health sector through a comprehensive UN Joint Program (WHO, UNICEF and UNFPA), entitled Joint Health and Nutrition Program (JHNP). UN organizations in Somalia are mainly non-implementing partners and therefore subcontract local organizations, such as Save the Children to perform and deliver services. Save the Children was the largest implementing partner organization within JHNP, which laid the foundation for the design of this new program after the JHNP ended. Sida, together with the Swiss Development Cooperation in Somalia (SDC), chose to proceed with Save the Children as an individual and direct partner, given the work previously implemented by the organization were successful. Save the Children also has access to many regions around Somalia, including hard-to-reach areas, which this contribution aims to focus on.\n\nThe choice to prepare a new support to Save the Children to strengthen the local health sector with particular attention to three regions - Galmudug, Jubbaland and Bari. The selection of regions for project implementation was guided by Save the Children, who concludes that these regions lag behind other regions in terms of access to essential health services. It is worth to remember that these regions are all previous JHNP regions and so continuation of services remains essential.  \n\nDecision on contribution will be taken by the Head of Afica Department at Sida Stockholm.",

As highlighted in the Economic Recovery Plan, issues around job creation, economic growth and private sector development will lie at the heart of Somali recovery and reconstruction.\n\nAccordingly, the overall objective of the programme is to contribute to the long-term reconstruction of the conflict ridden society in Somalia through increased human security and improved livelihoods, while the specific objective of the intervention is employment creation and improved incomes for those economically active specifically for women and youth across the country. The programme is intended to be catalytic and engage the diaspora for the purpose of leveraging funds as well as transferring knowledge. With strong entrepreneurial propensities and cultural linkages to Somalia, the Somali diaspora in Sweden and elswhere can play an important part in developing businesses that can create jobs in Somalia. It is important to clarify that the programme does not only target the diaspora but Somali entrepreneurs in the country are also eligible for the programme.\n\nThe programme employs  a comprehensive approach that consists of four major components which are intended to complement each other:\n1. A Capacity Development Facility (CDF) for interested entrepreneurs and potential grantees. the CDF will be divided into a general capacity development in business development as well as a tailor-made capacity development for grantees.\n2. A Challenge Fund module that offers financing to entrepreneurs at an early stage of\nthe business venture in order to enable them to explore opportunities and start up a business with potential for job creating opportunities.\n3. Access to more capital support function which is intended to support grantees and interested entrepreneurs to access financing from other challenge funds or through Sida\u2019s guarantee systems for larger finances.\n4. A Scale up analysis module which is intended to collect and convey analysed market data into the New Deal/PSG4 policy level for improved policies that will contribute to enabling environment for business throughout the country.\n\nBy combining these four components the programme puts in place the necessary prerequisites for successful and sustainable business creation and hence increased productive employment. The engagement of the diaspora will not only leverage funds and businesses but will also contribute to knowledge transfer in the long term. Furthermore, the data collected from the programme through its scale up analysis module will be expected to contribute to positive changes at the policy level and hopefully have bigger positive impact at the national level.\n\nThe programme has identified opportunities in certain sectors which is believed could have potential to have wider impact on business growth and hence contribute to productive employment. These identified sectors are: Agriculture, fisheries, healthcare, ICT, renewable energy and water & sanitation.

Sida\u2019s Central Organisational Assessment of UNHCR (2015) concludes that the organisation\u2019s systems for internal control are adequate according and in line with Sida contribution regulations. \n\nSida provides support, in addition to the MFA's annual core contribution, based on the UN Consolidated Appeals (HRP) and UNHCRs Global Appeal, Supplementary Budget Appeals and UNHCR Regional Response Plans (RRRP). Sida allocates funding to UNHCR on a country / regional level and support is unearmarked at this level. During the year Sida assesses UNHCR's Supplementary Appeals for possible additional funding through supplementary decisions.\n\nWith its mandate, to protect refugees, forcibly displaced communities and stateless people, and assist in their voluntary repatriation, local integration or resettlement to a third country, UNHCR is alongside ICRC Sida\u2019s key protection partner. In addition to its operational role in the protection of refugees, UNHCR has a normative role in monitoring and interpreting the Refugee Convention. UNHCR is the lead Agency in Refugee operations within the humanitarian system with responsibility to coordinate UN agencies and NGOs response in refugee crisis.

Increase access to, utilisation and quality of health and nutrition services at community, primary and secondary health levels, especially for women, children and vulnerable populations and; 2. Strengthen the health system under the stewardship of the Somali Health Authorities (SHAs). The project\u2019s approach focuses on strengthening the SHAs\u2019 capacity at the regional, district and community levels to deliver the EPHS (core services 1-6). Lessons from Joint Health Nutrition Programme (JHNP) and other programmes, identified a critical management gap at the district level in Banadir. A core focus of the project\u2019s methodology is therefore to support the Regional health Officer (RHO) in Banadir to establish and develop a District Health Management Team (DHMT) in each of the 10-targeted districts. Having an operational management body at district level, within the SHA structure, will be an essential component of ensuring that the health facilities and community/female health workers (CHWs/FHWs), in their respective districts, are able to receive the technical, management and logistical support required for them to successfully deliver integrated, quality, health and nutrition services that the population can access. This is a structure and model that has been demonstrated to be successful in other health systems (e.g. in Kenya). The consortium will work closely with the RHO throughout the project to establish, develop and support the DHMTs.",

        "description": "Reprogrammed funds to mitigate the impact of COVID-19\nThis intervention builds on current ongoing Sida support to the World Bank Multi-Partner Fund for Somalia (2014-2018), decision number 2014-003041. The current Sida support to the WB-MPF focus on four areas:\n1. Enabling economic growth\n2. Effective and accountable government\n3. Urban infrastructure\n4. Analytical and technical assistance.\n\nIn September 2018, the World Bank Board of Directors approved a new four-year strategy for Somalia 2019-2022. This strategy is the first World Bank strategy for Somalia in 30 years and signals a renewed confidence and trust by the World Bank in Somalia\u00b4s road map to development. This Country Partnership Framework (CPF) is currently funded by 10 donors through the the Multi-Partner Fund modality for delivery. Sweden is the fourth biggest contributor to the fund. The MPF modality is per definition a pooled fund mechanism with is the preferred mechanism of financing in conflict and post-conflict contexts. The MPF is one of three pooled funding mechanisms in Somalia established as part of the Somalia Development and Reconstruction Facility. The MPF is administered by the World Bank and operates in close cooperation with the federal government of Somalia and the contributing donors. WB-MPF are well aligned with government priorities, as articulated in the National Development Plan (2017-2019) and together cover all eight pillars of the NDP. Hence, national ownership and alignment to principles of development effectiveness is adhered to. As Administrator of the Trust Fund, the World Bank is responsible for ensuring that the MPF and its funds are used in accordance with the administrative agreements and that recipients use MPF funds in accordance with the grant agreements.\n\nThe MPF has a specific focus support to core state functions, socioeconomic recovery and sustainable development compared with the UN Fund being more broad in scope and the AfDB focusing on rehabilitation and development of infrastructure. Sida has provided support to UN-MPTF since 2015 (decision number 2015-002435 and 2018-001376). The AFDB-SIF is currently the only funding window which Sida does not contribute. The AFDB-SIF has only started in 2017.\n\nThe overall aim of the CPF 2019-2022 is to lay foundations for the longer-term poverty reduction and inclusive growth by focusing on priority areas and constraints creating the current Somalia \"dual development trap\" created by low level of trusts and exacerbated by widespread vulnerability of repeated shocks. The strategy has two focus areas (1) Strengthening Institutions to Deliver Services and (2) Restoring Economic Resilience and Opportunities. The first focus area will strengthen ongoing governance programs with a new focus on fiscal space and improving access to - and quality of - key social services and resilience. Programs will specifically target public finance management reforms, domestic revenue mobilization and resource sharing, basic delivery systems for social services; and urban resilience. The second focus area aims to increase economic resilience as a basis for long-run poverty reduction and inclusive growth by improving business environment and lowering barriers to market entry, increasing access to finance for inclusion and digital development; and improved access to water and renewable energy. \n\nAlthough the new World Bank strategy covers the period 2019-2022, Sida proposal for support is during 2019-2020, with a total amount of 200 million SEK as well as a support to current MPF programs of 75 million SEK in 2018. Depending if and when the World Bank manage to secure additional IDA financing and if the World Bank manages to re-adjust current plans for the health sector in line with Sida recommendations, Sida will consider contributing additional funds to the MPF during 2021-2022.\n\nTo regulate Sida\u2019s commitment and conditions for supporting the Somalia MPF, Sida and the World Bank will use the 2016 template agreed in December 2016 by Consultative Group on Operational Principles for Trust Funds and Partnership (CGOP) \u201cModel Form of Administration Agreement Model Form \u2013 SDTF/MDTF\u201d. It is important for Sida to use the new administrative agreement since the new template better reflects the Swedish law on disclosure. The new agreement also includes improved language on informing donors on incidences of suspect corruption and reporting which are both priorities to Sida\u2019s line of working. The new administrative agreement template can only apply for new Trust Funds \u2013 or when all donors agree simultaneously to agree to transfer.  Given the significant legal differences between the 2016 template and the previous template currently used for the MPF, Sweden and other donors have exerted pressure to the World Bank to support processes to apply the new 2016 template for new contributions to the Somalia Multi-Partner Trust Fund. In order to accommodate the request by Sweden and other donors who would like to use the 2016 template and exploring different options, the WB has agreed to create a new Multi-Partner Trust Fund, referred to as \u2018MPF Phase 2\u2019. The structure of the MPF Phase 2 means that World Bank will continue to report externally in one consolidated MPF Report but internally there will be two systems across which the World Bank will have to manage the Somalia investment portfolio over a few years. This effectively means an increased administrative cost. Sida has in its decision valued the benefits of using the new agreement template despite the higher administrative the new trust fund entails. The present Trust Fund is valid until 2024 with possible extension of the period. Therefore, Sida finds it difficult to enter into a new multi-year contribution agreement with the current template that does not correspond to Swedish law. Moreover, more MPF donors are expected to gradually shift to the MPF Phase 2, whereby the costs for administration is expected to decline. Other donors have already expressed interest in joining the MPF 2 in the near future. Sweden will also assert its influence among donors and advocate the phasing out of the existing Trust Fund.\n\nThe World Bank will be overall responsible for implementation but the delivery model implies that 80-85% of MPF projects are recipient executed. This means that large shares of the funding to MPF will be channeled through the Federal Government of Somalia and Federal member states. The risk of using country systems in Somalia is considered high. However, the use of country systems maximizes the effectiveness of aid and can help government legitimacy and public support, strengthening the accountability between the State and its citizens. The World Bank does not have an office in Mogadishu yet, but are gradually increasing their presence in Somalia albeit the World Bank\u00b4s presence on the ground is limited, but the World Bank works closely with the Somali authorities, both at national and sub-national level. The World Bank deploys a third-Party Monitoring Agent to support the monitoring of the World Bank\u00b4s projects as well as supporting the Bank teams in understanding the risks and manage the risks. The third-party monitoring agent also provides targeted support to the government in rebuilding and strengthening their Public Financial Management systems.It is Sida\u00b4s assessment that the World Bank as the cooperation partner has routines, resources and competence to ensure adequate internal management and control.  \n\nSomalia is making good progress in core reform areas such as the establishment of the Somalia Financial Management Information System, mechanisms for fiscal transfers between the federal government and federal member states, and improved central bank oversight and supervision. To date, the government has successfully conducted two Staff Monitored Program (SMP I and II) and embarked on a third SMP. Somalia has been identified as eligible for debt relief under the Highly Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) initiative given its unsustainable debt levels. The MPF shows a good track record and results which indicates that there are positive causal links between the MPF programs and the progress that Somalia has made since the establishment of the MPF. \n\nThe WB-MPF portfolio has contributed to crucial reforms such as macroeconomic stability and building a track record for arrears clearance and debt relief. There is evidence that potential access to IFI financing, in the relatively short term, and eventual debt relief in the longer term, are proving powerful incentives for reforms, particularly in public finance management. The MPF private sector development support has been critical for business reforms and engaging the private sector. Developing the Somali private sector is imperative to Somalia\u2019s peace and prosperity, and the government and donors need to work closely with the private sector on economic growth priorities. Nevertheless, the challenges for Somalia are still daunting in many areas such as improving macro-fiscal framework, implementing crucial tax measures to raise revenue, enacting key legislation, forging a political consensus on a federal model and strengthening the capacity of key institutions. \n\nOverall risk level in Somalia:\nViolence and armed conflict as well as political instability are some of the main obstacles to economic and social development in Somalia. Apart from the political and security challenges, Somalia is in a difficult humanitarian situation. Climate change and recurring periods of drought regularly affect the population and its resilience is low after decades of conflict and instability. More concretely, the following general risks that can negatively affects the MPF programs have been identified:\n\u2022\tWorsened security situation and increased Al-Shabaab attacks that can destabilize the country.\n\u2022\tSomalia\u00b4s transition as well as clan/fraction related local conflicts.\n\u2022\tHigh level of corruption and culture of nepotism affecting MPF programs.\n\u2022\tPolitical instability due to the federalization process as well as upcoming elections (both FMS level and federal level).\n\u2022\tRecurrent natural disasters and/or conflict might disrupt the World Bank's MPF long term development interventions where donors might have to re-prioritize or re-program available funds depending on the severity of the shocks. This might affect donor contributions to the MPF and available funds to MPF, meaning less contributions to the MPF.\n\nThe appraisal memorandum has been written in English, as English-speaking personnel at the Embassy in Nairobi participate in the appraisal and follow-up of the contribution, in accordance with the General Director's decision regarding choice of language as per the instructions from 1 March 2013.",

Hence, national ownership and alignment to principles of development effectiveness is adhered to. As Administrator of the Trust Fund, the World Bank is responsible for ensuring that the MPF and its funds are used in accordance with the administrative agreements and that recipients use MPF funds in accordance with the grant agreements.\n\nThe MPF has a specific focus support to core state functions, socioeconomic recovery and sustainable development compared with the UN Fund being more broad in scope and the AfDB focusing on rehabilitation and development of infrastructure. Sida has provided support to UN-MPTF since 2015 (decision number 2015-002435 and 2018-001376). The AFDB-SIF is currently the only funding window which Sida does not contribute. The AFDB-SIF has only started in 2017.\n\nThe overall aim of the CPF 2019-2022 is to lay foundations for the longer-term poverty reduction and inclusive growth by focusing on priority areas and constraints creating the current Somalia \"dual development trap\" created by low level of trusts and exacerbated by widespread vulnerability of repeated shocks. The strategy has two focus areas (1) Strengthening Institutions to Deliver Services and (2) Restoring Economic Resilience and Opportunities. The first focus area will strengthen ongoing governance programs with a new focus on fiscal space and improving access to - and quality of - key social services and resilience. Programs will specifically target public finance management reforms, domestic revenue mobilization and resource sharing, basic delivery systems for social services; and urban resilience. The second focus area aims to increase economic resilience as a basis for long-run poverty reduction and inclusive growth by improving business environment and lowering barriers to market entry, increasing access to finance for inclusion and digital development; and improved access to water and renewable energy. \n\nAlthough the new World Bank strategy covers the period 2019-2022, Sida proposal for support is during 2019-2020, with a total amount of 200 million SEK as well as a support to current MPF programs of 75 million SEK in 2018. Depending if and when the World Bank manage to secure additional IDA financing and if the World Bank manages to re-adjust current plans for the health sector in line with Sida recommendations, Sida will consider contributing additional funds to the MPF during 2021-2022.\n\nTo regulate Sida\u2019s commitment and conditions for supporting the Somalia MPF, Sida and the World Bank will use the 2016 template agreed in December 2016 by Consultative Group on Operational Principles for Trust Funds and Partnership (CGOP) \u201cModel Form of Administration Agreement Model Form \u2013 SDTF/MDTF\u201d. It is important for Sida to use the new administrative agreement since the new template better reflects the Swedish law on disclosure. The new agreement also includes improved language on informing donors on incidences of suspect corruption and reporting which are both priorities to Sida\u2019s line of working. The new administrative agreement template can only apply for new Trust Funds \u2013 or when all donors agree simultaneously to agree to transfer.  Given the significant legal differences between the 2016 template and the previous template currently used for the MPF, Sweden and other donors have exerted pressure to the World Bank to support processes to apply the new 2016 template for new contributions to the Somalia Multi-Partner Trust Fund. In order to accommodate the request by Sweden and other donors who would like to use the 2016 template and exploring different options, the WB has agreed to create a new Multi-Partner Trust Fund, referred to as \u2018MPF Phase 2\u2019. The structure of the MPF Phase 2 means that World Bank will continue to report externally in one consolidated MPF Report but internally there will be two systems across which the World Bank will have to manage the Somalia investment portfolio over a few years. This effectively means an increased administrative cost. Sida has in its decision valued the benefits of using the new agreement template despite the higher administrative the new trust fund entails. The present Trust Fund is valid until 2024 with possible extension of the period. Therefore, Sida finds it difficult to enter into a new multi-year contribution agreement with the current template that does not correspond to Swedish law. Moreover, more MPF donors are expected to gradually shift to the MPF Phase 2, whereby the costs for administration is expected to decline. Other donors have already expressed interest in joining the MPF 2 in the near future. Sweden will also assert its influence among donors and advocate the phasing out of the existing Trust Fund.\n\nThe World Bank will be overall responsible for implementation but the delivery model implies that 80-85% of MPF projects are recipient executed. This means that large shares of the funding to MPF will be channeled through the Federal Government of Somalia and Federal member states. The risk of using country systems in Somalia is considered high. However, the use of country systems maximizes the effectiveness of aid and can help government legitimacy and public support, strengthening the accountability between the State and its citizens. The World Bank does not have an office in Mogadishu yet, but are gradually increasing their presence in Somalia albeit the World Bank\u00b4s presence on the ground is limited, but the World Bank works closely with the Somali authorities, both at national and sub-national level. The World Bank deploys a third-Party Monitoring Agent to support the monitoring of the World Bank\u00b4s projects as well as supporting the Bank teams in understanding the risks and manage the risks. The third-party monitoring agent also provides targeted support to the government in rebuilding and strengthening their Public Financial Management systems.It is Sida\u00b4s assessment that the World Bank as the cooperation partner has routines, resources and competence to ensure adequate internal management and control.  \n\nSomalia is making good progress in core reform areas such as the establishment of the Somalia Financial Management Information System, mechanisms for fiscal transfers between the federal government and federal member states, and improved central bank oversight and supervision. To date, the government has successfully conducted two Staff Monitored Program (SMP I and II) and embarked on a third SMP. Somalia has been identified as eligible for debt relief under the Highly Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) initiative given its unsustainable debt levels. The MPF shows a good track record and results which indicates that there are positive causal links between the MPF programs and the progress that Somalia has made since the establishment of the MPF. \n\nThe WB-MPF portfolio has contributed to crucial reforms such as macroeconomic stability and building a track record for arrears clearance and debt relief. There is evidence that potential access to IFI financing, in the relatively short term, and eventual debt relief in the longer term, are proving powerful incentives for reforms, particularly in public finance management. The MPF private sector development support has been critical for business reforms and engaging the private sector. Developing the Somali private sector is imperative to Somalia\u2019s peace and prosperity, and the government and donors need to work closely with the private sector on economic growth priorities. Nevertheless, the challenges for Somalia are still daunting in many areas such as improving macro-fiscal framework, implementing crucial tax measures to raise revenue, enacting key legislation, forging a political consensus on a federal model and strengthening the capacity of key institutions. \n\nOverall risk level in Somalia:\nViolence and armed conflict as well as political instability are some of the main obstacles to economic and social development in Somalia. Apart from the political and security challenges, Somalia is in a difficult humanitarian situation. Climate change and recurring periods of drought regularly affect the population and its resilience is low after decades of conflict and instability. More concretely, the following general risks that can negatively affects the MPF programs have been identified:\n\u2022\tWorsened security situation and increased Al-Shabaab attacks that can destabilize the country.\n\u2022\tSomalia\u00b4s transition as well as clan/fraction related local conflicts.\n\u2022\tHigh level of corruption and culture of nepotism affecting MPF programs.\n\u2022\tPolitical instability due to the federalization process as well as upcoming elections (both FMS level and federal level).\n\u2022\tRecurrent natural disasters and/or conflict might disrupt the World Bank's MPF long term development interventions where donors might have to re-prioritize or re-program available funds depending on the severity of the shocks. This might affect donor contributions to the MPF and available funds to MPF, meaning less contributions to the MPF.\n\nThe appraisal memorandum has been written in English, as English-speaking personnel at the Embassy in Nairobi participate in the appraisal and follow-up of the contribution, in accordance with the General Director's decision regarding choice of language as per the instructions from 1 March 2013.",

        "title": "WB Multi-Partner Fund Somalia 2018-2021",
        "description": "Reprogrammed funds to mitigate the impact of COVID-19\nThis intervention builds on current ongoing Sida support to the World Bank Multi-Partner Fund for Somalia (2014-2018), decision number 2014-003041. The current Sida support to the WB-MPF focus on four areas:\n1. Enabling economic growth\n2. Effective and accountable government\n3. Urban infrastructure\n4. Analytical and technical assistance.\n\nIn September 2018, the World Bank Board of Directors approved a new four-year strategy for Somalia 2019-2022. This strategy is the first World Bank strategy for Somalia in 30 years and signals a renewed confidence and trust by the World Bank in Somalia\u00b4s road map to development. This Country Partnership Framework (CPF) is currently funded by 10 donors through the the Multi-Partner Fund modality for delivery. Sweden is the fourth biggest contributor to the fund. The MPF modality is per definition a pooled fund mechanism with is the preferred mechanism of financing in conflict and post-conflict contexts. The MPF is one of three pooled funding mechanisms in Somalia established as part of the Somalia Development and Reconstruction Facility. The MPF is administered by the World Bank and operates in close cooperation with the federal government of Somalia and the contributing donors. WB-MPF are well aligned with government priorities, as articulated in the National Development Plan (2017-2019) and together cover all eight pillars of the NDP. Hence, national ownership and alignment to principles of development effectiveness is adhered to. As Administrator of the Trust Fund, the World Bank is responsible for ensuring that the MPF and its funds are used in accordance with the administrative agreements and that recipients use MPF funds in accordance with the grant agreements.\n\nThe MPF has a specific focus support to core state functions, socioeconomic recovery and sustainable development compared with the UN Fund being more broad in scope and the AfDB focusing on rehabilitation and development of infrastructure. Sida has provided support to UN-MPTF since 2015 (decision number 2015-002435 and 2018-001376). The AFDB-SIF is currently the only funding window which Sida does not contribute. The AFDB-SIF has only started in 2017.\n\nThe overall aim of the CPF 2019-2022 is to lay foundations for the longer-term poverty reduction and inclusive growth by focusing on priority areas and constraints creating the current Somalia \"dual development trap\" created by low level of trusts and exacerbated by widespread vulnerability of repeated shocks. The strategy has two focus areas (1) Strengthening Institutions to Deliver Services and (2) Restoring Economic Resilience and Opportunities. The first focus area will strengthen ongoing governance programs with a new focus on fiscal space and improving access to - and quality of - key social services and resilience. Programs will specifically target public finance management reforms, domestic revenue mobilization and resource sharing, basic delivery systems for social services; and urban resilience. The second focus area aims to increase economic resilience as a basis for long-run poverty reduction and inclusive growth by improving business environment and lowering barriers to market entry, increasing access to finance for inclusion and digital development; and improved access to water and renewable energy. \n\nAlthough the new World Bank strategy covers the period 2019-2022, Sida proposal for support is during 2019-2020, with a total amount of 200 million SEK as well as a support to current MPF programs of 75 million SEK in 2018. Depending if and when the World Bank manage to secure additional IDA financing and if the World Bank manages to re-adjust current plans for the health sector in line with Sida recommendations, Sida will consider contributing additional funds to the MPF during 2021-2022.\n\nTo regulate Sida\u2019s commitment and conditions for supporting the Somalia MPF, Sida and the World Bank will use the 2016 template agreed in December 2016 by Consultative Group on Operational Principles for Trust Funds and Partnership (CGOP) \u201cModel Form of Administration Agreement Model Form \u2013 SDTF/MDTF\u201d. It is important for Sida to use the new administrative agreement since the new template better reflects the Swedish law on disclosure. The new agreement also includes improved language on informing donors on incidences of suspect corruption and reporting which are both priorities to Sida\u2019s line of working. The new administrative agreement template can only apply for new Trust Funds \u2013 or when all donors agree simultaneously to agree to transfer.  Given the significant legal differences between the 2016 template and the previous template currently used for the MPF, Sweden and other donors have exerted pressure to the World Bank to support processes to apply the new 2016 template for new contributions to the Somalia Multi-Partner Trust Fund. In order to accommodate the request by Sweden and other donors who would like to use the 2016 template and exploring different options, the WB has agreed to create a new Multi-Partner Trust Fund, referred to as \u2018MPF Phase 2\u2019. The structure of the MPF Phase 2 means that World Bank will continue to report externally in one consolidated MPF Report but internally there will be two systems across which the World Bank will have to manage the Somalia investment portfolio over a few years. This effectively means an increased administrative cost. Sida has in its decision valued the benefits of using the new agreement template despite the higher administrative the new trust fund entails. The present Trust Fund is valid until 2024 with possible extension of the period. Therefore, Sida finds it difficult to enter into a new multi-year contribution agreement with the current template that does not correspond to Swedish law. Moreover, more MPF donors are expected to gradually shift to the MPF Phase 2, whereby the costs for administration is expected to decline. Other donors have already expressed interest in joining the MPF 2 in the near future. Sweden will also assert its influence among donors and advocate the phasing out of the existing Trust Fund.\n\nThe World Bank will be overall responsible for implementation but the delivery model implies that 80-85% of MPF projects are recipient executed. This means that large shares of the funding to MPF will be channeled through the Federal Government of Somalia and Federal member states. The risk of using country systems in Somalia is considered high. However, the use of country systems maximizes the effectiveness of aid and can help government legitimacy and public support, strengthening the accountability between the State and its citizens. The World Bank does not have an office in Mogadishu yet, but are gradually increasing their presence in Somalia albeit the World Bank\u00b4s presence on the ground is limited, but the World Bank works closely with the Somali authorities, both at national and sub-national level. The World Bank deploys a third-Party Monitoring Agent to support the monitoring of the World Bank\u00b4s projects as well as supporting the Bank teams in understanding the risks and manage the risks. The third-party monitoring agent also provides targeted support to the government in rebuilding and strengthening their Public Financial Management systems.It is Sida\u00b4s assessment that the World Bank as the cooperation partner has routines, resources and competence to ensure adequate internal management and control.  \n\nSomalia is making good progress in core reform areas such as the establishment of the Somalia Financial Management Information System, mechanisms for fiscal transfers between the federal government and federal member states, and improved central bank oversight and supervision. To date, the government has successfully conducted two Staff Monitored Program (SMP I and II) and embarked on a third SMP. Somalia has been identified as eligible for debt relief under the Highly Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) initiative given its unsustainable debt levels. The MPF shows a good track record and results which indicates that there are positive causal links between the MPF programs and the progress that Somalia has made since the establishment of the MPF. \n\nThe WB-MPF portfolio has contributed to crucial reforms such as macroeconomic stability and building a track record for arrears clearance and debt relief. There is evidence that potential access to IFI financing, in the relatively short term, and eventual debt relief in the longer term, are proving powerful incentives for reforms, particularly in public finance management. The MPF private sector development support has been critical for business reforms and engaging the private sector. Developing the Somali private sector is imperative to Somalia\u2019s peace and prosperity, and the government and donors need to work closely with the private sector on economic growth priorities. Nevertheless, the challenges for Somalia are still daunting in many areas such as improving macro-fiscal framework, implementing crucial tax measures to raise revenue, enacting key legislation, forging a political consensus on a federal model and strengthening the capacity of key institutions. \n\nOverall risk level in Somalia:\nViolence and armed conflict as well as political instability are some of the main obstacles to economic and social development in Somalia. Apart from the political and security challenges, Somalia is in a difficult humanitarian situation. Climate change and recurring periods of drought regularly affect the population and its resilience is low after decades of conflict and instability. More concretely, the following general risks that can negatively affects the MPF programs have been identified:\n\u2022\tWorsened security situation and increased Al-Shabaab attacks that can destabilize the country.\n\u2022\tSomalia\u00b4s transition as well as clan/fraction related local conflicts.\n\u2022\tHigh level of corruption and culture of nepotism affecting MPF programs.\n\u2022\tPolitical instability due to the federalization process as well as upcoming elections (both FMS level and federal level).\n\u2022\tRecurrent natural disasters and/or conflict might disrupt the World Bank's MPF long term development interventions where donors might have to re-prioritize or re-program available funds depending on the severity of the shocks. This might affect donor contributions to the MPF and available funds to MPF, meaning less contributions to the MPF.\n\nThe appraisal memorandum has been written in English, as English-speaking personnel at the Embassy in Nairobi participate in the appraisal and follow-up of the contribution, in accordance with the General Director's decision regarding choice of language as per the instructions from 1 March 2013.",

The establishment of NIH will mean that Somalia will for the first time in Somalias history have an independent authority with responsibility for quality assurance for healthcare. \n\nThe federal MoH has laid down the legal foundation necessary for the establishment of NIH. This process has been approved by the federal parliament, cabinet ministers and the auditor general of the federal government of Somalia in February 2019. In terms of more specific objectives for NIH, the following are stipulated in the proposal submitted to Sida: \n- Provide evidence-based advice to the Federal MoH and to the regional authorities responsible for health and act as the national reference laboratory for infectious diseases. \n- Improve the emergency and preparedness of the nation against foreseen and unforeseen natural or man man-made disasters. \n- Improve the reproductive and the maternal health of Somalia.\n- Train future leaders who have an evidence-based approach to public health interventions, health services and health policy.\n- Eliminate health disparities and improve measurable health outcomes through sustained community and organizational partnership.\n- Serve as the national focal point for international health regulations. \n- Implement other mandates that are allocated to NIH by the government.",

        "description": "SPIDER was founded as a center for expertise concerning ICT for development at Sida's initiative and was initially housed by the Royal Institute of Technology and later by Stockholm University, which is Sida's agreement partner. Sida has since continued to provide a multi-year non-earmarked support to SPIDER. SPIDER acts as the Swedish operational counterpart and advisor for a number of Sida\u2019s ICT for development (ICT4D) projects in countries prioritized by Sida. SPIDER mobilizes a network of Swedish and international experts in the area of information and communications technology (ICT) for development to help developing countries use ICT as a tool to efficiently and strategically drive development and poverty reduction goals - in this case, in the area of health. The proposed initiative aims to establish a National Health Management Information System (HMIS) in Somalia. There is no such initiative currently in the country. Establishing an effective HMIS is included in WHO's six basic building blocks for health systems. Current fragmentation and lack of data and information make it difficult, if not impossible, for Somali healthcare providers to plan, manage and deliver quality healthcare across the country in a cost-effective manner.\n\nSPIDER proposes an initial 12-month start-up phase during which SPIDER will conduct a review of the current data and information situation and capacity in Somalia, analysis of regional needs, including an assessment of the health system in the two selected regions (Galmudug and Puntland), recruitment and posting of project staff and mapping of relevant stakeholder. The two selected regions were determined by SPIDER in consultation with the Federal Ministry of Health in Somalia. The two selected regions reflect the current healthcare system in Somalia. The Galmudug region represents one of the weakest health systems with limited capacity and reach. The Galumudug region is also partially controlled by Al-Shabaab, which makes it difficult to access critical maternal and child health care. The Puntland region, on the other hand, has one of the most developed health systems in Somalia's federal government. The region is quite stable, and the Ministry of Health has sufficient capacity and experience compared to Galmudug. SPIDER also proposes to create a central hub for data storage and management in Mogadishu. Lessons learned from the first introductory phase will guide decisions to scale up the initiative to other regions. In summary, the project aims to design, establish and deliver a health information management system for that is suitable for Somalia's infrastructure and public health needs. The development of HMIS is an important issue for the federal government and is included among seen health care priorities.",

        "description": "New/additional funds to address COVID-19\nSomalia is one of the fastest urbanizing countries in the world. The rapid urbanization is caused by significant forced displacements from rural areas into urban areas driven by conflicts, insecurity, search for economic opportunities and cyclical environmental adversities such as drought and famine. This has a huge impact not only upon livelihood opportunities, peace and stability and resilience, but also shifting rural and pastoralist livelihood to urban economies. The urban influx raises many challenges for the provision of basic urban services including secure access to land for settlement of IDPs and existing vulnerable communities. Lack of effective land administration and planning systems and weak institutions has led to arbitrary distribution of land and has aggravated contestation over land, housing and basic services. Intense competition over land exacerbates forced evictions particularly among IDPs and urban poor.\n\nThe focus of this programme will be to promote inclusive employment opportunities for urban vulnerable populations, increase youth participation; integration of displacement affected households and to strengthen implementation of Durable Solutions and Youth development across Somalia. The programme will be implemented in Mogadishu, Kismayo, Baidoa and Dollow which are some of the majorly affected towns/cities.",

The programme is a follow-up phase of the \"IMS-Fojo Somalia Programme 2014-2018\" which amounted to a total figure of 57 MSEK.\n\nIn order to avoid an activity gap between the first and second phase, IMS/Fojo decided to start implementing the programme from 1st of January 2019 with temporary funding from IMS headquarter. This was done with the aspiration of Swedish funding for the second phase coming through during spring 2019.

        "description": "This joint intervention between WFP and FAO together with the Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation (MoAI) and the farmers\u2019 cooperatives will  consolidates and complements FAO and WFP past and ongoing interventions for enhancing livelihoods, resilience and economic development. The project will combine capacity building support to smallholders and private sector organizations to enhance rural services based on public-private collaboration, creating better job opportunities, income, and livelihoods for smallholder farmers in selected agricultural crop value chains. \n\nThis project complements the ongoing work by FAO and WFP with cooperatives in rain-fed and riverine farming in Somalia that is addressing crop production, productivity, quality and market access issues. The project will strengthen the resilience of riverine and agro pastoralist by building their capacities to absorb and adapt to shocks and stressors in the food system. The project will also have a transformative effect on the resilience of food systems by supporting the development of sustainable local institutions to manage food production, post-harvest management and marketing. Further, the project will support development of the target value chains to improve effectiveness and efficiency.\n\nThe outcome of the proposed project will be to enhance food and nutrition security and incomes therefore improving resilience of communities to threats and crises. Within the rain-fed and riverine areas, the project will support 20 farming cooperatives, of up to 250 smallholder farmers in each group. These cooperatives will provide farmers the opportunity to move beyond subsistence farming with access to high quality inputs, extension services and links to high value market actors. By aggregating their supply and production needs, these farmer groups can achieve the economies of scale needed to access more profitable markets. When properly equipped and managed, farmer groups act as shock absorbers in times of crisis \u2013 through savings schemes, pooled resources and other support mechanisms.",

        "description": "Long-running conflict has destroyed the infrastructure of the Somali state and the country has one of the worst health indicators in the world. The high-risk groups are 2.4 million children under age 5 and more than 3 million women of child-bearing age. Ac\ncording to WHO the maternal mortality ratio is 732 per 100 000 live births although most of the maternal deaths would be preventable. Rebuilding the health sector is challenged by a shortage of professional staff financial resources and effective governanc\ne and NGOs have played a key role in providing with these services. African Care?s Maternity Clinic and Training project has since its start in 2012 supported the development of the FinSom maternity clinic together with the local partner VMDSO. Results sho\nw that the service of the clinic has decreased maternal mortality rate prevalence of tetanus raised awareness about exclusive breast feeding and FGM. The clinic is well-known in Afgoye and surrounding areas and a vital source of quality maternal health car\ne for both expectant mothers and the community. Hence the maternal health care services are continued also in the continuation phase of the project.The project at hand seeks to further enhance the capacity and services of the partner and the clinic so that\n eventually maternal health services could be provided without development cooperation funding. This is done by investing in the education and training of the VMDSO staff and health workers and monitoring the long-term impact of the trainings. Simultaneous\nly invaluable information on the key challenges and development needs will be mapped out and used for future trainings.  Also the support of the sexual violence victims will be intensified. It will be expanded to an in-person counselling in addition to the\n telephone support. Open-access seminars and family counselling are likewise continued and further intensified. Seminars about gender equality family planning and gender-based violence work to dismantle unequal social structures through open dialogue. Proj\nect's beneficiaries are women in labour children victims of sexual violence clinic?s personnel and partner organization VMDSO.",

        "description": "The project aims at improving the capacity of public sector health and education institutions to provide quality services with special focus on vulnerable groups: women children and youth through skills and knowledge transfer by the Somali diaspora. The ov\nerall objective of the project is to contribute to stabilization in South Central Somalia and Puntland through increasing access to basic services (health and education) and creating employment opportunities for the youth including women. In addition young\n Somalis will be placed in internship positions under the supervision of the diaspora experts at relevant institutions. The project trains health and education sector professionals to produce quality public services in health and education and to administe\nr the resources of the sectors. The trainers are diaspora experts especially Finnish diaspora who work and share their expertise in the sectors.The Mid-Term Evaluation which was finalized in August 2018 showed that results have been gained in both health a\nnd education sectors. For example the intake of patients at Yardimeli Hospital in Mogadishu has increased significantly in a short period of time from around 800 patients in July 2017 to around 4000 in March 2018. Moreover the number of assisted births inc\nreased substantially. The diaspora experts placed at the Ministry of Education were successful in supporting the organizational reform and writing key strategic planning documents for the sector. According to the Mid-Term Evaluation the project was very re\nlevant in filling the gaps and specialized needs in the institutions. According to all participants both local and the diaspora the project was successful in producing sustainable results in skills and knowledge. The implementing partner is the Internation\nal Organisation for Migration (IOM). From 2015 to 2019 Finland has supported the project with 4 420 000 EUR. From 2019 to 2021 the total budget for the second phase funded by Finland is 5 400 000 EUR. The budget is disbursed as follows: 1 MEUR in 2019; 24 \nMEUR in 2020; 2 MEUR in 2021.",

They train the local health professionals and participate in developin\ng strategies plans standards and curricula for health sector. Particular attention is given to women's and child health. In the long term the project is expected to contribute to better health outcomes for Somaliland population and especially the health ou\ntcomes for women and children.The first Finnish funded MIDA project was initiated already in 2008. The project has been evaluated twice and the findings suggest that the project has significantly strengthened public health institutions? ability to provide \nquality services in Somaliland. The findings and recommendations of evaluations have been duly notified in the planning of the Finnsom IV phase: For example the project now focuses on the more remote regions in Somaliland where service provision is poorer \nthan in the capital Hargeisa. Similarly following the recommendations the length of the assignments of diaspora experts has been increased for Phase IV.To support the implementation of the project the National Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) also im\nplements tailored trainings for the Ministry of Health.The duration of the Phase IV is four years from March 2017 until February 2021.

        "description": "The project builds on the previous TB intervention implemented by LSV. However in order to increase effectiveness totally new strategies will be applied.TB continues to be an essential health problem in Somalia. The disease hasn't been beaten yet but rathe\nr new problems emerge such as multi-drug resistant forms of TB resulting in much more complex treatment regimens and bigger danger to the population.LSV will continue to diagnose and treat TB patients in Hargeisa and Mogadishu. As a new strategy the privat\ne sector health care providers (clinics and pharmacies) and local communities will be engaged in the effort in a systematic way in order to strengthen a holistic public-private-people partnership approach to tackling the disease. In addition collaboration \nwith the local maternity and child health facility network will be strengthened. The overall objective is to contribute to the reduction of TB burden and suffering in Somalia. The immediate objectives of the project include 1) To increase TB awareness and \nparticipation of communities in TB control. 2) To increase TB awareness and participation of private practitioners and pharmacists in TB control in. 3) To diagnose and treat patients at two TB centers according to WHO's DOTS protocol. 4) To provide TB cult\nure services and drug susceptibility tests (DST) for suspected MDR cases.Regarding the cross-cutting themes the project will empower women and facilitate their access to TB services. In addition the project will reduce inequality by providing an access to \nTB services for internally displaced persons (IDPs). When it comes to climate proofing there are no negative impacts on environment. For example thanks to community DOTS there will be less daily traveling to TB Centers.The main project partners include NGO\n called PSR and National TB Programs (NTPs). LSV will strengthen their capacity in all the fields described above.The main beneficiaries include local people of Hargeisa Mogadishu and nomads living in nearby areas who have TB or belong to risk groups. The \nproject will help the poorest of the poor. For example many cases are found among people who suffer from malnutrition.",

        "description": "The project is founded on PSR's previous projects in Somalia which have developed new strategies to tackle tuberculosis (TB) ? especially in community and private sector engagement. A special focus will be placed on women and vulnerable community members: \ndisabled persons IDPs and prisoners. Tuberculosis is a central health problem in Somalia. The increase of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a global threat ? fighting against MDR-TB in Somalia benefits all countries. Another central problem is \nthe low treatment coverage rate of about 37% leaving far too many cases untreated further transmitting tuberculosis to others. The impact targets of the project are to: a) tackle multi-drug resistant tuberculosis; and b) increase the tuberculosis case dete\nction rate. The long-term objective of the project is to contribute to the reduction of the tuberculosis burden in Somalia with the following means:1. Increase the access of women and vulnerable groups to TB services (such as disabled personsIDPs and priso\nners)2. Increase TB referrals from the private sector3. Improve the quality of TB treatment in both the public and private sector4. Improve the quality of TB laboratory work.The central partners of the project are the National Tuberculosis Programmes of So\nmaliland and Somalia. PSR has a central role in developing the national tuberculosis diagnostic infrastructure in Somalia. The project will support the National TB Reference Laboratories in Somaliland and South-Central Somalia as well as will treatment of \ntuberculosis patients in 3 clinics in Hargeisa and Mogadishu. These clinics will develop innovative community public and private sector engagement models to increase case detection improve treatment quality and to increase public awareness and decrease sti\ngma/discrimination. The clinics will also provide HIV services and nutritional support for malnourished patients (with WFP).Together with the local administration the tuberculosis clinics will be transformed into health centers providing specialized tuberc\nulosis services by the end of 2022 to support integration with basic health services and sustainability after the project has ended.",

        "description": "A locust invasion in Somalia is threatening livelihoods as crops and vegetation for livestock foraging suffer extensive damage. According to the Somaliland National Disaster Preparedness and Food Reserve Authority (NADFOR) localized damage has been observed in Somaliland, where locusts have occupied a total of 100,000ha of Somaliland\u2019s coastal region including Woqooyi Galbeed. This has affected1,087,264 people, of which 22,853 are in IDPs camps. SC has observed the impact of the locust invasion to be most severe in Hargeisa Maroodijeh with 8,000ha of rangeland and 3,000ha of crop land damaged. In addition, Agabar and Arbasiyo villages in Gabiley districts have also been hard-hit with 1,000ha of damaged land. The Woqooyi Galbeed region was already characterized by significant food security gaps which is exacerbated by the desert locust crisis. According to the FSNAU technical release 153,000 people are food insecure (IPC 3 or 4) including 12,054 in Gabiley district and 139,134 in Hargeisa district. An SC survey showed that pastoralists are skipping meals or selling their remaining livestock for low prices to purchase food. There is also an increasing trend of labor migration at the critical time of Gu seasonal preparation. Only few actors respond to the locust crisis in this area including SOS and World Vision. Response gaps affirmed by the Food Security Cluster (FSC) monthly dashboard show 150,000 people need urgent Multi-Purpose Cash (MPC) support to protect access to food security. These include IDPs and pastoralists who have lost their livestock and have less than 6 goats. In addition to the locust crisis, Somalia is also at risk of an outbreak of the COVID-19 virus. Somalia reported its first confirmed case of COVID-19 on 16th March 2020 and currently has 60 recorded cases including 5 in Somaliland and 2 in Woqooyi Galbeed. Given the rapid pace of the virus and lack of access to testing kits, there are concerns that the number of cases will rise rapidly.",

        "description": "This Joint FGS-UN Programme aims to capitalise on recent security, governance and reconciliation achievements by expanding employment opportunities for young men and women, mainly in newly recovered areas. The programme recognizes the centrality of youth in fostering stability in the country and outlines specific interventions that can be taken within the next 24 months to begin to generate decent work opportunities for young people that will serve as positive alternatives to participation in violence and conflict. This will also contribute to the revitalization of the local economy. The programme will tackle youth at risk, unemployed and underemployed youth. The employment generating interventions from this programme also aim to augment the credibility of the FGS and build trust and confidence in local governance and security sector institutions while providing immediate peace dividends to vulnerable sub-sections of the population. As encouraged in the New Deal Compact, this joint youth employment programme is a frontline intervention of the FGS to achieve rapid results under Peace and State-building Goal (PSG) 4 (Economic Foundations), which identifies youth employment through job creation and skills development as one of the most important priority projects over the next two years. Creating growth and job opportunities are a crucial part of development assistance and Somalia is in urgent need of decent employment and income generation opportunities. The private sector is responsible for 90 percent of jobs in developing countries, making it an essential partner in the fight against poverty and the engine of innovation, investment and growth. There are many obstacles which stand in the way of private sector development, the mains ones being: unfavourable investment climate, infrastructure shortages, lack of access to finance, lack of skills development opportunities and weak linkages between supply and distribution chains. Tackling such constraints will create job opportunities for young Somali men and women. Therefore, the FGS, with the support of UN agencies, will undertake the following interventions in newly recovered areas and other government priority areas over the next 24 months. The programme will initially be tailored for the first 24 months as per the Compact deadline (see also Table 1): \u2022 1: Improved long-term potential for growth, productivity and employment of at least three value chains in the agriculture, fisheries and livestock sector. \u2022 2: Equip 10,000 youth with basic literacy, numeracy and life-skills and sector-specific vocational and business training to enhance their employability to access sustainable job opportunities in sectors with high growth and employment potential. \u2022 3: Create 30,000 short-term jobs created through cash-for-work projects to rehabilitate productive infrastructure in target locations, mainly in newly recovered areas.",

        "description": "This project is part of the ILO ILO Flagship Programme on Jobs for Peace and Resilience and is based on the Employment and Decent Work for Peace and Resilience Recommendation, 2017, (No. 205). It builds on ongoing work to promote employment, decent work and income opportunities in Somalia. The project strategy draws on the findings of the review of the DWCP of Somalia (2014-2016), which among other issues, has pointed to the need for tailored capacity development interventions to enable workers and employers organizations to deliver services to their members and effectively engage in social dialogue. The project interventions will focus on: (i) addressing the youth employment challenges; (ii) creating a strong connection between humanitarian and development support; (iii) building on employment-intensive investment strategies; and (iv) integrating direct employment creation and skills and enterprise development for increased employability. The project is expected to provide opportunities for the ILO to leverage resources, expertise and synergies at the country level, notably through cooperation and collaboration within the UN system as well as with development partners. This project contributes to the country\u2019s efforts to advance towards the attainment of SDG targets 1.5 (Build the resilience of the poor and those in vulnerable situations and reduce their exposure and vulnerability to climate-related extreme events and other economic, social and environmental shocks and disasters) and 8.3 (Promote development-oriented policies that support productive activities, decent job creation, entrepreneurship, creativity and innovation, and encourage the formalization and growth of micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises, including through access to financial services).",

Expanding energy access in the country has the potential to increase the productivity and competitiveness of Somali businesses, contribute to alleviating poverty (both of which could lead to increased investment), improve health and education outcomes, and bolster security. Women\u2019s Economic Empowerment gives women the independence, confidence, and ability to transform their lives. There is a direct correlation between improvements in health, education, peace, and security and the eventual success of women entrepreneurs to catalyse change within their regions, clans, towns, and families.

This is the reality for people living in tents and makeshift shelters without running water or soap in places like Syria, Yemen and Somalia.\n\nBut, as we have seen in the UK, simple measures can make a huge difference. If we act now to protect millions of vulnerable refugees and displaced people, many lives can be saved. \n\nWe need your help to: \n\nprovide families with clean water, soap and information on keeping themselves safe \nprovide frontline medical and aid workers with equipment and supplies to care for the vulnerable and sick\nensure families get enough food to prevent malnutrition, particularly amongst children\nPeople who have already suffered so much need your help now more than ever to face this new threat.

Training and provision ofveterinary start-up kits for 40 Community Animal Health Workers will benefit 3.600 households for treatment of their livestock.\nIn the WASH component of the action these communities directly benefit from a comprehensive package of immediate access to safe water, sanitation facilities and improved hygiene practices, including Cash for Water for 3 months for 1.760 of the most vulnerable households, improved storage capacity by provision of 16 communal water tanks, 2 jerry cans per household, and 420 emergency latrines for 4.167 HH (25.002 people), improved access to water by provision of fuel for 5 strategic borehole generators for 3 months, and maintenance of the boreholes will benefit 25.000 individuals (4.167 HH). To promote a safe water chain, Oxfam will distribute water treatment tablets for 3 months to cash for water recipients through hygiene promotion activities, for point of use household water treatment, with a focus on community engagement and participation. This will be accompanied by promotion of the adoption of good hygiene practices. Oxfam will also focus on community engagement initiatives including action planning, periodic review meetings on progress and programme processes, as well to obtain community feedback on the implementation modalities. Community volunteers will be trained on safe water chain, transmission route of water and sanitation related diseases, and preparation of oral rehydration solution (ORS) to promote adoption of good hygiene practices and manage dehydration amongst communities.\nAll this will be further supported throughprotection interventions. An ongoing protectionanalysis will ensure that activities can adapt to changes in the protection situation, that protection trend information can be shared with appropriate stakeholders, and that advocacy can be carried out where appropriate and necessary. Information on protection and existing services will be disseminated to women and men in target communities so that they are able to make informed decisions when faced with a protection threat or issue. WaSH and EFSL community committees and volunteers will be trained on protection risk analysis, and on how to receive and transmit protection information responsibly. A totalof 3.500 households will benefit from better information and a improved programming as a result.'",

Training and provision ofveterinary start-up kits for 40 Community Animal Health Workers will benefit 3.600 households for treatment of their livestock.\nIn the WASH component of the action these communities directly benefit from a comprehensive package of immediate access to safe water, sanitation facilities and improved hygiene practices, including Cash for Water for 3 months for 1.760 of the most vulnerable households, improved storage capacity by provision of 16 communal water tanks, 2 jerry cans per household, and 420 emergency latrines for 4.167 HH (25.002 people), improved access to water by provision of fuel for 5 strategic borehole generators for 3 months, and maintenance of the boreholes will benefit 25.000 individuals (4.167 HH). To promote a safe water chain, Oxfam will distribute water treatment tablets for 3 months to cash for water recipients through hygiene promotion activities, for point of use household water treatment, with a focus on community engagement and participation. This will be accompanied by promotion of the adoption of good hygiene practices. Oxfam will also focus on community engagement initiatives including action planning, periodic review meetings on progress and programme processes, as well to obtain community feedback on the implementation modalities. Community volunteers will be trained on safe water chain, transmission route of water and sanitation related diseases, and preparation of oral rehydration solution (ORS) to promote adoption of good hygiene practices and manage dehydration amongst communities.\nAll this will be further supported throughprotection interventions. An ongoing protectionanalysis will ensure that activities can adapt to changes in the protection situation, that protection trend information can be shared with appropriate stakeholders, and that advocacy can be carried out where appropriate and necessary. Information on protection and existing services will be disseminated to women and men in target communities so that they are able to make informed decisions when faced with a protection threat or issue. WaSH and EFSL community committees and volunteers will be trained on protection risk analysis, and on how to receive and transmit protection information responsibly. A totalof 3.500 households will benefit from better information and a improved programming as a result.'",

        "description": "On 2nd February 2020 the Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation of the Federal Government of Somalia has declared a national emergency (see press statement in attachment) in view of the current Desert Locust upsurge that poses a major threat to Somalia#sfragile food security situation. Food sources for people and their livestock are at risk. The Desert Locust swarms are uncommonly large and consume huge amounts of crops and forage.\nAccording to locust office of the Ministry of Agriculture and HADMA  latest report, there were huge swarm of Desert locust from Yemen that at the end September 2019 laid eggs in many locations in Somaliland. Despite controlefforts, a serious and widespread desert locust outbreak is threatening crops and pasture across Northern Somali regions. Accordingto experts, this is the worst outbreak in over 25 years in Somalia.\n\nThe situation has rapidly deteriorated in January 2020, as weather conditions have been unusually conductive to the spread of the pest. After cyclone Pawanmade landfall in early December 2019, flooding across the Horn of Africa created favourable breeding conditions for desert locusts. These conditions allow the breeding until June 2020 and could lead to 500 times more locust with the formation of large numbers of swarm as FAO indicated in their latest Appeal .\nDesert Locust breeding is ongoing in Somaliland, Puntland and Galmudug (Mudug). An estimated 70,000 hectares of land has been invaded by hoppers and breeding adults. Once they mature the locusts areexpected to migrate in swarms and move south towards the Ethiopian border area of Somaliland as well as Jubaland, Southwest State and Hirshabelle. These swarms will be at their most destructive stage and pose a very severe risk to Deyr season food and fodder production.\nMating adults, hoppers and swarms have been detected in Northwest Somalia (between Bulhar and Silil). Hoppers and immature adults were reported on the Northwest plateau and a swarm was detected between Burao and the Ethiopian border. Hopper bands were also reported south of Bossaso, south of Las Anod (near the Ethiopian border) and in Galmudug (near Galkayo). More swarms are likely to form along the Northwest coast and plateau, which may migrate to Djibouti, Eastern Ethiopia and SouthernSomalia.\nCrop and pastures have already been damaged in Somalia impacting negatively onagropastoral and pastoral households. In December 2019, it was reported that a huge number of desert locust (still at the stage of hopper bands) hatched in differentbreeding areas of Somaliland, such as coastal areas and farming land, posing a new devastating threat to crops and pasture lands.",

Their work will be accompanied by the installment of innovative hands-free handwashing stations designed and produced in the TVET centres of partner Havoyoco. These measures will reach another 30,000 people across Somaliland.",

Beneficiarieswho don\u2019t possess Sim-cards will receive them as part of this response and be trained on its usage. The overall Oxfam food securityintervention which this contributes towards will include additional emergency livelihoods and recovery elements including cash for work interventions to rebuild destroyed feeder roads.Oxfam targets households that meet the critical food insecurity criteria takingintoconsideration gender-differentiated needs. The selection criteria will be discussed with thetarget women, men, boys and girls toensure fairness of the selection process. Usually, women are registered as beneficiaries and the head of the household for cash transfers.

Oxfam will deliver emergency food security interventions through cash grants for the most vulnerable people, while supporting household income by strengtheningand diversifying livelihoods through other projects. Oxfam's programming since March 2017 has successfully diversified the source of livelihoods in traditional pastoralist communities in Somaliland with plansto replicate this expereicnce in Puntland. This intervention will help vulnerable households to have some disposable income which they can use to purchase or meet their household food needs.Most vulnerable community members that will be most in need of the emergency assistance through this action will be identified through participatory mapping exercises conducted at village level through specific exercises including well-being rankings, vulnerability mapping, food consumption score, household purchasing power, among others. Gender will be consideredwhen selecting households to help reduce the additional burden on women headedhouseholds. The criteria shall be clearly explained to the selection committee/panel prior toselection, with clearcommunication on what beneficiaries will be entitled to during the project, to avoid unrealistic expectations.",

        "title": "CO-Drought & Sever Water Shortages Respo",
        "description": "2020 was one of the hardest years for Somalia in decades. Flooding, COVID-19 and recurring locust invasions heavily impacted on theeconomy and livelihoods of people. The government implemented measures to contain COVID-19, including the closure of schools, reduction of movement and other economic activities. The coastal areas of Puntland and Somaliland were also hit by cyclone Gati in November 2020, resulting in a sharp increase in humanitarian needs which many organizations - including Oxfam Somalia - responded to. While the performance of the 2020 Gu rain was near normal, the Deyr rain of 2020 has been categorized a complete failure due to the La Nina conditions. These developments triggered severe water shortages in many regions and districts in Somalia. Since October 2020, regional administrations, communities and other humanitarian agencies have been sending alerts about looming drought conditions in many parts of Somalia.Oxfam\u2019s feedback hotline continues to receive a high number of calls from people requesting immediate water interventions. These callers are mainly from the Sool, Sanaag and Togdheer regions. UNOCHA assessment findings indicate that over 50% of the communities in the assessed locations reported displacement of people due to water shortages, 85% raised major concerns on watershortages, and 14 out of 40 villages reported an increase in diarrheal cases. The price of water has already more than doubled. According to Oxfam\u2019s own market assessment, one barrel of water is currently being sold at an average of USD 4.5 per barrel, with some villages reporting over USD 7 per barrel. This is forcing the most vulnerable households to travel long distances to fetch water and/or opt for poor water quality and risk their lives. The most affected communities include IDPs and low-income host communities. Women and girls are at risk of protection-related risks as they travel in search of water.\nRegarding COVID-19, over 4,784 cases with over 130 fatalities were registered by the WHO in Somalia since the start of the pandemic, with many cases left undetected due to asymptomatic infections, low testing capacity and the stigmatisation of COVID-19 cases among the population. The second wave of the pandemic seems to have also hit the country as the number of cases started to increase in the last few months. The government of Somaliahas eased most of the restrictions in August 2020 and most of the public services have resumed. This increases the risk of vulnerability to COVID-19 and the shortages of water in many areas further restrict the communities' ability to frequently wash their hands with soap. This might create a favourable environment for COVID-19 to spread.\nThe Ministry of Water Development in Somaliland shareda request with all humanitarian agencies, indicating that over 196,848 people are in need of urgent water interventions and that many others also require quick rehabilitations of their water sources. Over 88% of the people in need are from the Sool, Sanaag, and Togdheer regions of Eastern Somaliland. In October 2020, Oxfam using the ECHO crisis modifier budget reached the most vulnerable 1,800 HH (10,800 people) in Sool, Sanaag, and Togdheer for 30 days with WASH interventions. Since then, we have continued to advocate for urgent interventions by sharing summary reports with the Somalia WASH cluster and presentations of the situation with cluster members. Utilising other existing resources, we are also working with the Ministry of Water Resources to rehabilitate boreholes that were identified as strategic wells by the government.",

        "description": "The first component is aimed at capacity building. At least 40 beneficiaries (at least 30% female) including fishermen and women, fishmongers will undergo a maximum of six months theoretical and practical training. Youth fishermen and women will be trained on safety at sea, fishing gear mending and repairs, safe fishing methods and fish preservation, cooperatives establishment and fish quality assurance. Fishmongers, who will mostly be women, will be trained in various topics including fish handling and preservation, fishprocessing, personal hygiene, value addition (processing, grading, and packaging) and small business management. Entrepreneurship will be an integral part of the courses in order to leverage the entrepreneurship capacity\nThe second component is aimed at supporting the establishment/ strengthening of fishery organizations. The target beneficiaries will be organized in Self Help Groups (SHGs). The SHG is a rights-based approach which views poverty as the denial of rights and poverty alleviation as a process of reclaiming one\u2019s rights. Given the multi-dimensional nature of poverty, the SHG Approach puts equal emphasis on the goals of economic, social andpolitical empowerment . Therefore, the established/strengthened SHGs will have the potential to empower small-scale fishers againstsome of the environmental and socioeconomic shocks such as fish catch shortfalls and revenues, sickness and death in their families, natural disasters and hunger. The 30 young fishermen will be organized intoat least 5 SHGs and will be trained/ oriented on the operations of the SHGs\nThe third component will support the distribution of fishing kits/gear to the SHGs including women fishmongers.Midway through the training, the project beneficiaries will be provided with fishing gears in their SGHs. Such gear may include boats and other necessary tools. On the other hand, women fishmongers, will have business start-up kits including refrigerators and basic fish processing tools. The fishing kits/ gear will be owned and managed jointly in the SHGs.\nThe fourth component will focus on learning and knowledge management through value chain research. In order to ensure systematic market mapping in the fishing sector, understand actors, market share, capacity gaps, and other relevant value chain information, the project will undertake a robust research on fish value chain. The research will aim to bring out suitable models to link small holders to input and output markets and improve the benefits that fishermen and women and other resource-poor value chain actors derive from the chain. Knowledge generated from the research will be disseminated to different relevant stakeholders in the sector. It will also act as a building block for future scaling efforts of the project. As Oxfam and the partner have both long-term livelihood strategies, the research finding would beused for future programing.",

It's evident that the Humanitarian Aid Dependency has largely affected the productivity of the Somali population. However, there's need to exhaust to what extent these will be addressed by our research questions for the Participatory Action Research (PAR) on Aid Humanitarian Aid dependency.\nIn 2019, nine Somali NGOs founded the Nexus platform that aims to shape the future in Somalia and Somaliland, by creating an enabling environment for Somali NGOs to have a leading role in the humanitarian system that puts the agency and self-reliance of communities at the center, through delivering a combination of Humanitarian Aid, Development, and Peace interventions. The Nexus coalition is led by nine Somali NGOs \u2013 African Development Solutions (ADESO), Centre for Peace and Democracy (CPD), Gargaar Relief and Development Organization (GREDO), Horn of Africa Voluntary Youth Committee (HAVOYOCO), KAALO, Save Somali Women and Children (SSWC), Social-Life and Agriculture Development Organisation (SADO), Taakulo Somaliland Community (TASCO), and WASDA.

In addition, special considerations will be given concerning practicality and implementation methodology including presence, scaleof the need, duration and coordination with other stakeholders.\nThe day-to-day activities of theplatform are performed by the Secretariat supported by the Steering committee who are also responsible for resource mobilization, organizing coordination meetings, fund management and drafting policies and guidelines\nIn 2021, the Nexus platform aims to implement efforts to support its members and government institutions in both Somalia and Somaliland, through development of Community-driven Development manuals, conducting Participatory Action Research that finds durable solutions on climate related challenges in both pastoral and agro-pastoral communities, conducting PAR that aims to address the level and scope of dependency created by Unconditional Cash disbursement to local rural communities as well as supporting Somalia and Somaliland governments to develop standardized Cash Transfer model with clear guidelines.\nSocial inclusion, protection and Covid-19 protocols will be maintained and mainstreamed in project interventions.",

In many places, they are non-existent, or if they are, not all of them are fully functional. The design of Oxfam\u2019s CBFCMs by Affiliates, Country Offices and in part Partners has not always ensured community involvement, in most cases resulting in not fit for purpose mechanisms. Also different affiliates still approach the issue of CBFCMs differently with different emphasis, approaches, tools and resources, therefore lacking a standardised coordinated approach.\n\nAlthough Oxfam prides itself for encouraging communities we work with to speak out and report PSEA and child protection concerns and incidents concerning them,recent reports in some countries like DRC, Ethiopia, and Uganda not only attests to the limited awareness at community level on SEAand child protection risks and reporting mechanisms, but has also led to an increase in attention to ensure that SEA and child abuse and exploitation by humanitarian and development organisations like Oxfam are addressed through investment in preventive approaches but also responding to reports of abuse and exploitation when these incidents are reported.\nOxfam has two responsibilities for accountability in the programmes it manages, holding a responsibility for mutual accountability with its partners (as do the partners) and also holding a shared or joint accountability (with its partners) to the communities affected by its programmes. There is lack of knowledge how the\nIn addition to some of the above challenges, COVID-19 has added additional challenges to how effective current CBFCMs are, placing additional barriers to reporting that are currently not fully understood or risks mitigated.\nOBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT:\n1. Map out existing CBCM\u2019s initiatives in select field/project locations, and document best practices and lessons learnt in implementing CBFCMs across the Oxfam confederation\n2. Undertake a rapid assessment of the existing CBFCMs in Oxfam terms of effectiveness, experiences and lessons plus existing gaps.",

        "description": "The eastern regions in Somaliland and especially Saanag and Sool regions continue to suffer from recurrent drought. This situation has increased the vulnerability of the communities as they have lost most of their livestock which was their main source oflivelihood. The situation is exacerbated by the fact that the two regions also continue to experience occasional inter clan fighting which isoften triggered by competition for available pasture and water resources. Drilling of the a boreholes will not only contribute to providing important water sources that can support the water needs of the communities during drought and harsh climatic conditions, but also contribute to reducing risk factors leading to conflict. It will offer an opportunity to the benefiting communities to have a chance for better access to potable water, reduce the incidents water related diseases and increase access for water for practicing frequent handwashing to prevent COVID-19.\nObjectives;\n\u2022 Provide sustainable water source for 5000 people and over 10,000 livestockheads in Sanaag Region.\nGroundwater Feasibility Study:\nA groundwater feasibility study will be conducted in three selected villagesof Sanaag region. the study will follow three approach method,\n1. Remote Sensing: Desk review using latest satellite imageries to selected best possible locations. This phase will focus on finding regional fractures carrying water from highland of Ethiopia to thelowland of Sanaag regions and from Sanaag mountains to low land areas.\n2. Geophysical Study: ground truthing work will be conducting using latest start of art geophysical technology at least three locations with spacing of 1000 -1500m. This location are those selected in first phase of the study work. Government and community engagement will be conducted to understand the local geology, possible impact of drilling on environment and stability of the communities.\nDrilling of the borehole\nBased on the groundwater feasibility study, the drilling work will be advertised through the local media. In order to avoid failures resulted from improper use of drilling equipment and selection of drilling method, the contractor will receive full copy of the study report and will be given a briefing on the drilling technology and technique recommended by the study team. Then, a payment by result approach will be used to contract drilling companies i.e. Oxfam/Taakulo will only pay if the borehole has water with discharge of above 2liter per second. Failureto get a contractor willing to commence drilling with such conduction, further meeting will be help between Oxfam and Taakulo to discuss best possible approach to increase value for money.\nSupervision and Monitoring:\nIn drilling works supervision and monitoring progress is critical step. Oxfam/Taakulo will have a site supervisor equipped with necessary materials for supervision including TDS Sensor to record water quality at each 1 meter, mud funnel to record the drilling mud viscosity and deeper to follow the depth of the drilling. The supervisor will provide daily update to both Oxfam/Taakulo team and will ensure all decision that affect drilling performance is consulted and agreed before action. TDS level will be recorded in monitoring tool provided and the result will be used for deciding the borehole casing arrangement. All materials that will be used for drilling will be inspected by the drilling supervisor and approve. In case a specialized chemical will be used for the drilling; the supervisor will request for all safety related certificate prior use of such chemicals.\nPost Drilling Construction:\nThis action will be decided right after the drilling is completed. Provision of submersible pump with cable and riser pipes, and construction of generator house, water distribution system for both animal and human and storage facilities will be included under this phase. Other grants, including ECHO 2021 and/or other internal grants will be used to finance this critical activity. Incase the borehole salinity is above an acceptable regional level i.e. 2500ppm, provision of desalination unit will be considered.",

        "description": "About 4.6 million people in Somalia are food insecure and 4.2 million are in need of humanitarian assistance. The reduction in the number of people in need since early 2018 has been attributed to favourable rainfall during the Gu season (April to June) and sustained humanitarian assistance. Over 1.5 million people face acute food security Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or higher) and approximately 3.1 million people are Stressed (IPC 2)1. Although the 2016/2017 drought has ended in most parts of Somalia, its adverse impact lingers among those who were impoverished or displaced, and pastoralists who lost all or most of their livestock, particularly in the north. Without sustained food and livelihood assistance, the latter are likely to remain in Emergency (IPC 4).\nWhile acute malnutrition rates have improved nationally to Serious from Critical, the overall prevalence of acute malnutrition remains largely unchanged from Deyr 2017/2018. Between August and December, 294,000 acutely malnourished children, including 55,000 severe cases, aged underfive, will require treatment and integrated support. The acute malnutrition burden over the next 12 months is projected to be 588,400 acutely malnourished children, including 110,500 severe cases. The persistently high levels of acute malnutrition are unlikely toreduce without addressing the underlying causes, particularly in internally displaced persons (IDP) settlements and in some rural areas",

The high-risk groups are 2.4 million children under age 5 and more than 3 million women of child-bearing age. Ac\ncording to WHO the maternal mortality ratio is 732 per 100 000 live births although most of the maternal deaths would be preventable. Rebuilding the health sector is challenged by a shortage of professional staff financial resources and effective governanc\ne and NGOs have played a key role in providing with these services. African Cares Maternity Clinic and Training project has since its start in 2012 supported the development of the FinSom maternity clinic together with the local partner VMDSO. Results show\n that the service of the clinic has decreased maternal mortality rate prevalence of tetanus raised awareness about exclusive breast feeding and FGM. The clinic is well-known in Afgoye and surrounding areas and a vital source of quality maternal health care\n for both expectant mothers and the community. Hence the maternal health care services are continued also in the continuation phase of the project.The project at hand seeks to further enhance the capacity and services of the partner and the clinic so that \neventually maternal health services could be provided without development cooperation funding. This is done by investing in the education and training of the VMDSO staff and health workers and monitoring the long-term impact of the trainings. Simultaneousl\ny invaluable information on the key challenges and development needs will be mapped out and used for future trainings.  Also the support of the sexual violence victims will be intensified. It will be expanded to an in-person counselling in addition to the \ntelephone support. Open-access seminars and family counselling are likewise continued and further intensified. Seminars about gender equality family planning and gender-based violence work to dismantle unequal social structures through open dialogue. Proje\nct's beneficiaries are women in labour children victims of sexual violence clinics personnel and partner organization VMDSO.",

The ov\nerall objective of the project is to contribute to stabilization in South Central Somalia and Puntland through increasing access to basic services (health and education) and creating employment opportunities for the youth including women. In addition young\n Somalis will be placed in internship positions under the supervision of the diaspora experts at relevant institutions. The project trains health and education sector professionals to produce quality public services in health and education and to administe\nr the resources of the sectors. The trainers are diaspora experts especially Finnish diaspora who work and share their expertise in the sectors.The Mid-Term Evaluation which was finalized in August 2018 showed that results have been gained in both health a\nnd education sectors. For example the intake of patients at Yardimeli Hospital in Mogadishu has increased significantly in a short period of time from around 800 patients in July 2017 to around 4000 in March 2018. Moreover the number of assisted births inc\nreased substantially. The diaspora experts placed at the Ministry of Education were successful in supporting the organizational reform and writing key strategic planning documents for the sector. According to the Mid-Term Evaluation the project was very re\nlevant in filling the gaps and specialized needs in the institutions. According to all participants both local and the diaspora the project was successful in producing sustainable results in skills and knowledge. The implementing partner is the Internation\nal Organisation for Migration (IOM). From 2015 to 2019 Finland has supported the project with 4 420 000 EUR. From 2019 to 2021 the total budget for the second phase funded by Finland is 5 400 000 EUR. The budget is disbursed as follows: 1 MEUR in 2019; 24 \nMEUR in 2020; 2 MEUR in 2021.",

Ministry of Health has increase\nd capacity to steer manage and coordinate the health sector The Somali diaspora experts particularly the Finnish Somali diaspora experts are the actors in the capacity building efforts. They train the local health professionals and participate in developin\ng strategies plans standards and curricula for health sector. Particular attention is given to women's and child health. In the long term the project is expected to contribute to better health outcomes for Somaliland population and especially the health ou\ntcomes for women and children.The first Finnish funded MIDA project was initiated already in 2008. The project has been evaluated twice and the findings suggest that the project has significantly strengthened public health institutions ability to provide q\nuality services in Somaliland. The findings and recommendations of evaluations have been duly notified in the planning of the Finnsom IV phase: For example the project now focuses on the more remote regions in Somaliland where service provision is poorer t\nhan in the capital Hargeisa. Similarly following the recommendations the length of the assignments of diaspora experts has been increased for Phase IV.To support the implementation of the project the National Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) also imp\nlements tailored trainings for the Ministry of Health.The duration of the Phase IV is four years from March 2017 until February 2021. The budget for the project is 4 300 000 Euros. Somalia is considered an LDC country.",

UNFPA has been among the three UN agencies that have been involved \nin the UN Joint Nutrition and Health Programme in Somalia (JHNP) which focused on the development of maternal and child health services. Finland supported the implementation of the programme for 15.5MEUR between 2014-2016. JHNP has provided services for an\n area covering half of Somalia's population. It has reached good results having significantly contributed to the reduction of maternal and infant mortality. Through JHNP UNFPA has supported the provision of maternal sexual and reproductive health services \nas well as contributed to improving their quality. UNFPA has supported the running of 135 maternal clinics; the training of midwifes in 15 midwiferies throughout Somalia; the provision of training on reproductive health for over 600 health care professiona\nls; as well as the provision of technical assistance to the ministries of health to support their capacity building including their work on health sector strategic development. As JHNP is coming to an end in early-2017 UNFPA continues the work to develop t\nhe reproductive maternal and child health care in Somalia according to its mandate.UNFPA country strategy for Somalia for 2011-2016 has been extended for one year to cover also 2017. Its overall objective is to improve the wellbeing of Somali people. The c\nountry strategy aims to achieve this through reducing maternal mortality and through supporting the realization of reproductive rights and services. In addition the strategy supports gender equality and combats gender-based violence as well as strengthens \nthe Somali statistical systems and promotes evidence-based planning and policy design.Three particular priority areas have been identified for 2017:1.Increased provision of comprehensive sexual and reproductive health services (around 50% of the annual bud\nget for 2017)2.Promotion of gender equality and prevention of gender-based violence (around 25% of the 2017 budget)3.Strengthened national capacity on use of quality disaggregated data for evidence-based planning and policy design on population and develop\nment issues (around 25% of the 2017 budget)Finland supports the implementation of the UNFPA Somalia country strategy for 2011-2017 for 2 million euros.",

Awdal is one of the regions affected by COVID19 as it connects Somaliland to Djibouti. The majority of people are dependent pity trades, small scale irrigation, and livestock, most of these activities have been affected, and communities reported a reduction of income. Existing water supply sources are mainly powered by a diesel generator that are purchased from the tariffs collected from the users. Associated water tariffs are sky rocking as access to diesel has reduced as restrictions are imposed on public transport. Out of the many strategic water sources, two sources are selected, supplying water for villages affected by COVID19 in Somaliland. Oxfam will install a solar system for these wells, and the action will reduce the cost of water tariff and increase community use of water for different purposes include handwashing.\n# Build the capacity of the WASH committees managing the solarizedse water sources by providing necessary tools and training them on both technical skill and financial management. This action will be led by the ministry of water department of scheme management. As we mobilize for the two sources an additional two boreholes within the sameareas will also be invited for the training. These will help to maximize use of expert time, cover nearby villages with capacity building plan and increase value for money by targeting more with same budget.\n# Support Somaliland Ministry of Water Development to ministry of water to finalize   the design and construction for WASH facilities to be shared with all WASH Cluster members in Somaliland. The national WASH cluster has prioritized this action as per the request from ministry and Oxfam will contribute for this action. The budget will be used to cover some of the consultancy fees or provide expertise to help them finalize the work.\n# Provide safeprogramming training for WaSH committees, district administrations, women groups other key stakeholders including traditional leaders    .\n# Protection awareness raising including community discussions on protection impact to address stigma and promotion of the call centre hotline   (already operational) to increase access to covid19 services for affected communities    .\n# Government capacity building/strengthen social safety net system in Somaliland : we will build the capacity of the government to be able to lead and coordinate Somaliland safety net program. Somalia launched safety net project called bahnano at Mogadishu but this has not been cascaded to Somaliland and Puntland. The government staff responsible for this are unable to run safety net due to their limited capacity. The project will target technical staff from the government and create enabling environment in the form of institutional capacity building including training of key staff, support implementation of beneficiaries selection and running coordination mechanisms smoothly.  Oxfam Somalia is implementing social safety net activity under GFFO top up. Under this activity the project aims improving supports to HHs in urban areas particularly COVID19 affected poorest or most vulnerable to prevent them to fall to poverty and destitution trap, manage COVID19 economic and social shocks and advance their lives <(>&<)> livelihoods. The government capacity in Somaliland on social safety net is to grow and as part of appeal fund, Oxfam will contribute to strengthening/establishing social protection system that leads COVID19 response project. Oxfam will partner with Somaliland Ministry of Employment, Social and Family as socialprotection responsible government body. Somaliland government capacity is yet to grow and this project will address this gap while also coordinating with other implementing agencies to strengthen their capacity to be able to lead social assistance and provide at scale in the future to its society as a right. The project creates an opportunity for governments to become the standard responders to large scale crises.",

The unemployment rate for youth aged 15 to 30 is 67% - one of the highest rates in the world. Among young women, it is even estimated at 74%. Youth in Somaliland are not just the future ofthe country, they are also the majority.\nWith 67% of the youth being out of work, the high unemployment rate forthe youth remains abig challenge in Somaliland, and this rate is even higher for young women. The unemployment rate for young women in the country is estimated to be 74%. Due to the insecurity over the last two decade and stagnant economic growth, jobs have not been created at a rate that is able to match the growth of the youth population.\nWomen often face stiff competition during business pitching/competitions and often shy away to compete with their fellow men or observe stigmatization. This conceptwill bridge this gap by specifically earmarking this Women in Tech competition for young women tech savvies to compete among each other.\nTo achieve a long lasting and sustainable economic and social transformation in the country, we must empower young women, create opportunities for prosperity and provide them with the necessary tools and resources.\nHence Innovate Ventures (IV) in partnership and collaboration with Oxfam aim to support, accelerate and grow the Somali women startup scene and accelerate the growth of women startups in technology to help them create employment opportunities, and improve the investment climate in the country",

        "description": "6.3 million people are currently in need of humanitarian assistance across Somalia and Somaliland, with 2.6 million internally displaced and an estimated 1 million displaced in nearby countries. Whilst the deepening climate crisis exacerbates needs, Somalia and Somaliland are becoming increasingly stable, as persistent war gives way to erratic conflict and increasing capacity of government. Despite this, international actors face the obstacles of persistent issues of restricted access and highly challenging security circumstances. Local actors by contrast are able to transcend these issues and to guide interventions with nuanced local knowledge. This represents an opportunity to lead and deliver humanitarian aid locally. Somalia is one of the countries where a Joint Response to a protracted crisis under the DRA (SOMJR) is being implemented. With the changing context towards greater local leadership, the SOMJR already focuses on widening the space for local responders in humanitarian emergencies and decision-making fora. However, the Joint Response is fully led by INGOs, which inevitably creates unequal power dynamics that can negatively impact on the meaningful localization sought by local partners in Somalia. The protracted crisis situation, the long-standing presence of the DRA in Somalia, as well as the emergence of strong local humanitarian actors present the reality in which this PoC process can be carried out, and where an innovative pilot Joint Response focusing on meaningful localization would beworth exploring.\nThe Nexus Platform is an innovative response to the need for joined-up, localized responses at the triple nexus of humanitarian, development and peace programming: intervening to deliver coordinated outputs in all 3 spheres, which is essential in the Somali context, where climate shocks and conflict perpetually undermine humanitarian and development outcomes and deepen humanitarian crises. Although specifically tackled in the Somali context here \u2013 climate shocks and conflict are global causes of ongoing humanitarian crises, making the Nexus Platform\u2019s approach pertinent to challenges at the triple nexus in parallel circumstances. Comprised of nine local NGOs (footprint 30m USD), Oxfam andSave the Children International and entirely locally led, the platform is operational across every region of Somalia and Somaliland. The platform is built upon principles of South-to-South learning and civil society strengthening, whereby expertise is openly exchanged between member organizations to build a consortium that is more than the sum of its parts. Humanitarian response is central tothe platform\u2019s nascent phase. The platform envisions both multisectoral humanitarian response and the development of an Anticipatory Response Mechanism \u2013 utilisingthe platform\u2019s breadth of local access to trigger pre-emptive early action. The platform urgently needs \u2013 and is invested in developing \u2013 a model for its humanitarian programme areas through a PoC process which will allow the platform to rethink conventional humanitarian approaches that are particularly open to question in contexts such as Somalia. The process used to develop this model will be additionally adapted for the development of the platform\u2019s ways of working in the development and peace spheres:whilst humanitarian actions are the platform\u2019s immediate priority in its current scope of work, programs exemplifying locally-led decision making are planned in community development, government and civil society strengthening, women\u2019s empowerment and other areas across the triple nexus and these will require their own guiding PoC processes.",

Whilst the deepening climate crisis exacerbates needs, Somalia and Somaliland are becoming increasingly stable, as persistent war gives way to erratic conflict and increasing capacity of government. Despite this, international actors face the obstacles of persistent issues of restricted access and highly challenging security circumstances. Local actors by contrast are able to transcend these issues and to guide interventions with nuanced local knowledge. This represents an opportunity to lead and deliver humanitarian aid locally. Somalia is one of the countries where a Joint Response to a protracted crisis under the DRA (SOMJR) is being implemented. With the changing context towards greater local leadership, the SOMJR already focuses on widening the space for local responders in humanitarian emergencies and decision-making fora. However, the Joint Response is fully led by INGOs, which inevitably creates unequal power dynamics that can negatively impact on the meaningful localization sought by local partners in Somalia. The protracted crisis situation, the long-standing presence of the DRA in Somalia, as well as the emergence of strong local humanitarian actors present the reality in which this PoC process can be carried out, and where an innovative pilot Joint Response focusing on meaningful localization would beworth exploring.\nThe Nexus Platform is an innovative response to the need for joined-up, localized responses at the triple nexus of humanitarian, development and peace programming: intervening to deliver coordinated outputs in all 3 spheres, which is essential in the Somali context, where climate shocks and conflict perpetually undermine humanitarian and development outcomes and deepen humanitarian crises.

In 2017, their work in Somalia/Somaliland reached 2,814,381 people - 1,717,809 being children with Health, Nutrition, Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH), Education, Food Security and Livelihoods (FSL) and Child Protection services. As Well as long-term development work, They scaled up to respond to humanitarian spikes caused by drought, floods and cholera outbreaks. They have worked closely with the Government and supported policy makers and communities across Somalia and Somaliland to develop and approve policies and systems that will ensure a protective environment for children. They believe in building resilience amongst communities in Somalia/Somaliland and are committed to doing so through: \u2022 Provision of basic social services in education, health, and protection \u2022 Strengthening of government capacity to deliver such services \u2022 Working with communities and children to promote their rights.

The project addresses urgent needs for water and sanitation provision in rural and peri-urban areas affected by recurring droughts and waterborne diseases such as acute watery diarrhea and cholera. Indeed, the state of disrepair of water and sanitation infrastructure is a major factor contributing to significant outbreaks of water-borne diseases, particularly diarrhea whose incidence rate in Somalia is 21%. The interventions proposed under this project will therefore improve the quality of life of about 175,000 people and their livestock in rural Somalia. They are articulated around the following two operational components: 1) capacity building and 2) construction / rehabilitation of water supply and sanitation infrastructure for stability and resilience that will create about 1,300 jobs. In addition, the project will promote the use of water for multiple purposes, community mobilization campaigns and awareness of health and hygiene issues will be conducted, practices of nond\u00e9f\u00e9cation in the open, through the community-led total sanitation approach will also be promoted. The total cost of the project is estimated at about UA 8,189 million.",

The  project  focuses  on increasing access to safe water, improved sanitation and strengthening capacity for improved delivery of water and sanitation services in Kismayo (Jubbaland State) and Baidoa (South West State) towns. The project will reduce  economic  and  social  exclusion  of  poor  and  vulnerable  groups in the  two  towns,  where an estimated 65% of the population live below the basic needs poverty line and 70% of the population is younger than 30 years is often unemployed by improving access to safe and reliable water supply. The project will improve access to affordable water supply and sanitation services in Kismayo and  Baidoa,  particularly for  the  Internally  Displaced  Persons  (IDP\u2019s) -who  comprise  43%  of  the population, have contributed significantly to the growing urban informality in the two towns, and are facing great hardship in accessing clean water and improved sanitation. Water and Sanitation tariffs will be reviewed to incorporate lifeline tariffs, which often ensure that those in greatest hardship can afford water  and  sanitation  services.  Selected  education,  health and  market facilities  will  also  benefit  from improved water and sanitation facilities and  hygiene training and promotion.  The  project  will  cost an estimated  UA 9.589 million  and its implementation period is 48 months with a completion date of September 2023.",

The project, which is part of Somalia's National Action Programme for Adaptation to Climate Change (NAPA), focuses on the need to prepare regional water resource management plans. It constitutes an important step in the efforts of Somaliland to develop and sustainably manage its water resources. The project will have four main components: (i) preparation of an integrated water resources management plan; (ii) preparation of an investment plan comprising projects and programmes for financing; (iii) design and implementation of priority rehabilitation works; and (iv) provision of sector support and capacity building. Through the preparation of a water resources management and investment plan, the project will not only improve water resources management, but catalyse the large investments needed to develop the sector. Over the long term, the project is expected to have a significant impact on efforts to recover from the impacts of the drought, help create water security and drought resilience, improve livelihoods and support economic recovery. Its implementation will be conducted over a period of 30 months after approval. The estimated total cost of the project, including duty and taxes, is \u20ac3,000,000.",
