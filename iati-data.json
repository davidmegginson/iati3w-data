        "description": "The key objective is to implement preventative measures for vulnerable groups that have limited access to COVID-19 prevention and response actions. This is to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in urban IDP settings. The intervention will focus on the most vulnerable groups: older people \u2013 forming approximately 2.7 per cent of the population and the urban poor and IDPs about 75% of the population. Assessments shows these as most vulnerable who are heavily impacted by COVID-19 infection. For this response, IRS seeks to complement the efforts of the government and other humanitarian organisation in Somalia by reaching approximately 40,000 beneficiaries directly and up to 200,000 indirectly.\n1. Risk communication and community engagement. The proposed project will support preventative measures to combat the spread of COVID 19. This will include extensive awareness initiatives using multiple media channels to support preventative action of the government and communities. The information/ education and communication is designed to reach the population  through print, audio-visual media messages, SMS and community mobilisation using religious/community/group leaders and elders. Display monitors on COVID 19 risks and prevention in local language will be installed at strategic locations such as roundabouts, airports and community centres in IDP camps.\n2.  Health: Strengthen existing health facilities in the selected IDP camps to combat COVID 19 infection. The proposed project will provide 18 PPE kits to seven health facilities in the seven IDP camps and the three designated COVID 19 referral hospitals. The proposed project will also set up and equip 11 COVID 19 screening centres in the to do surveillance and early detection at the primary health care centres in the IDP camps, provide cleaning and sterilising equipment and supplies to these facilities to limit hospital infections.\n3. WASH: Reduce the spread of COVID 19 and decrease morbidity and mortality in the selected districts. The project improve hygiene practices, limiting infection IDP camps.24 hand-washing stations will be built in the IDP camps in Bondhere, Baidoa, Balcad, Gardho and Burtinle. Hygiene kits, containing bath soap, laundry soap, 2 jerry cans, and facemask, will be supplied to 3500 households. Special consideration will be given to female headed household and PWD. \n4. Livelihood: Improving livelihoods through unconditional cash transfer of USD 70 for 3 months to 333 households, and USD 70 cash assistance for 2 months to 333 households as livelihoods support. The beneficiaries will be selected using robust selection criteria that targets the most vulnerable and prioritise female headed household. The UCT will be done using mobile money transfer which has the benefit of increased security, convenience, privacy, speed, reduced operational/transaction costs and logistics for the beneficiaries and for Islamic relief. Somalia has large mobile network reach. The choice of money gives the beneficiaries the widest range of transactional capabilities and broad access to basic financial services (such as deposit, withdrawal, person-to-person transfers and e-money transactions with registered traders of goods and service providers). Islamic Relief used mobile money in drought/ flood emergency programme (including WFP Baxnaano programme). The lessons from previous experience which guide the choice of UCT include: \n-  Beneficiaries purchase a more diverse set of goods, had higher dietary diversity,\n- Beneficiaries depleted fewer assets and grew more types of crops, especially marginal cash crops grown by women.  They are able to o restock livelihood assets faster. The reasons for this can be attributed to the lower costs and greater privacy of receiving a cash transfer via the mobile transfer, as well as changes in intra-household decision-making.\n5. Establish complaint management and feedback mechanism to the affected population. Through this intervention, IR MEAL unit will ensure that project delivers responses as designed to the affected population. Through an established mechanism of complaints mechanism and feedback channels, the affected population will be made to understand and demand their rights until all is provided to their satisfaction. \n6. Build and establish DRR community champions for covid-19 preparedness, response and treatment. The established committee is trained on covid-19 risk reduction management. Their role is to ensure that community members are made aware of the impact of covid-19, where to seek treatment and how to enforce containment measures such as social distancing and use of mask and sanitisers as part of exposure reduction. \nIRS will lead the implementation. The project will build on existing IRS interventions in health WASH and livelihood sectors and maximise the impact and sustainability",

        "description": "Apart from the other layers of hazards existing in the target areas, COVID-19 had also impacted small scale farmers. It has been reported many farmers have abandoned their farming and sought an alternative source of income from the nearby towns. This has increased and exposed the farmers to the risk of COVID 19. \nA.\tFood security of poor farmers through revitalizing agricultural production in the targeted areas. Through cash for work, irrigation canal will be rehabilitated, and farm inputs will be supplied.  The rehabilitation work will be on excavating (desilting) of flood damaged canals.  This will improve the accessibility and availability of water for irrigation uses. Two canals with dimension of 2m width and 1m depth and 2km length will be rehabilitated. Each canal will provide water to 10 farms. In addition to this, the farmers will receive an improved seed such as maize, sesame, tomatoes and pumpkins.  Availing water and seeds to farmers will improve their farm activities and reduce the risk of seeking labour to unsafe environments. In doing this the farmers will start producing by themselves and subsequently able to both feed their families and sell their produce. The project will link to farmers to the existing potential markets through establishing a network between agriculture traders and target farmer groups.  This activity will be done for 15 days by 200 farmers at a rate of $5 per day. Each farm will be distributed with farm equipment\u2019s worth $200\n\nB.\tIncreased employment opportunity through VSLA and income generating activities:  As COVID 19 had mostly impacted poor and vulnerable people who were dependent on market activities such as labour, aid and family support. In the first phase, the project had transferred cash to maintain the minimum food basket for target households.  The cash had supported families to sustain their livelihoods in specific periods of the project. In order to move to an early socio-economic recovery, on the second phase, the project intends to transition from short term cash transfer to more sustainable income generating activities.  The project will introduce a village, saving and loans association approach (VSLA) to improve access to financial resources for poor households, targeting women in priority. The primary purpose of a VSLA is to provide simple savings and loan facilities and through these and other enabling activities empower women to manage resources and invest them for the benefit of their household. Loans can provide a form of self- insurance to members, supplemented by a saving fund which provides small but important income to members in distress. The VSLA system enables members of a self-selected group to voluntarily save money through purchasing shares. The savings are then invested in a loan fund from which members can borrow as well as meet their immediate needs such as food, water and health care or make further investments to diversify and increase their incomes. The project will support 15 VSLA groups of 15 \u2013 20 members with initial seed fund of 3000 USD for each group. The activity will start with community mobilization, selection of households to participate and group formation. While the methodology is simple, it depends on a very carefully structured system of training. Over seven sessions, groups learn to: form their associations; define a purpose; elect officials; design their system of savings, insurance and credit; and practice running savings and credit meetings. Once this process is completed, VSLAs can begin to save and to lend. They are supervised over a period of 12 months by field staffs who ensure procedures and systems work properly and that the groups can function independently thereafter;\n\nC.\tHealth: Strengthened capacity of existing health facilities and services to combat Covid-19. The proposed project will provide 18 PPE kits to 3 health facilities in the seven IDP camps and the three designated COVID 19 referral hospitals. The proposed project will equip 11 COVID 19 screening centres in the to do surveillance and early detection at the primary health care centres in the IDP camps, provide cleaning and sterilising equipment and supplies to these facilities to limit hospital infections. Other activities also include procurement of medicines, community mobilization outreach and training of frontline health workers. IR will also work with the government hospitals and other unit of covid-19 task force in the preparation of covid roll-out. IR will support through advocacy and media outreach for people to accept and take the vaccines. This approach of advocacy, lobbying through media and electronic information sharing will enable the roll-out of vaccines. IR will also use its health facilities as centre for passing information to patients and their dependents to take up vaccines once its made available. Similarly, IR will by making available a vehicle and a driver support the ministry of health with logistics mainly in Balaad, Baidoa and Bandar districts.\n\nD.\tWASH: The project will expand water points in IDPs. In some IPDs for instance Dayniile district, the accessibility of water stands for handwashing is still very small. The water point will allow beneficiaries to easily access water points for handwashing in their proximity.  The expansion will include laying out of pipes and construction of fenced water points. The expansion will improve the sanitation and hygiene of IDP communities so that they can prevent from themselves the spread of COVID 19 pandemic. The water points will be placed in strategic position such as schools and health centres. Additionally, IR will construct water tanks, piping system, training of water committee with a view to make water available for covid-19 prevention. \n\nE.\tProtection: Since there is a prevailing reports of incidence of gender based violence, early marriage, the project will carry out an awareness sessions including training of women and men. These sessions will be in line with Islamic Relief Somalia safeguarding and protection principles.",

        "title": "SRC Agreement 2017-2019",
        "description": "On January 27, 2017 the Swedish Red Cross (SRC) submitted an application to Sida for the above-mentioned program with an initial budget of 167.5 MSEK for 2017, 16 MSEK for 2018 and 16 MSK for 2019. The overall objective of the program is to strengthen the resilience of people and communities to crises, and their capacity to recover afterwards, and to reduce the risk that people and communities are affected by crises and disasters. A novelty of the new agreement period is that three country-projects (Afghanistan, DR Congo and Myanmar) are offered multiyear financing as they are protracted crises with a need for preidictable finansing to secure necessary resources and ensure predictability and contextspecific impact.\n\nFunds allocated for 2017 will be disbursed in two different payments, after signature of the agreement and after 1 September 2017, following approval of implementation of the action plan established by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies regarding internal management and control. Funds allocated for Ukraine and for a scaled up response in South Sudan (from a budget of 4,5 MSEK to13,5 MSEK) will be disbursed after the SRC has provided Sida with, and Sida's approval of, additional applications for these contexts, and after the SRC has demonstrated in written that the corruption case in Ukraine has been investigated and closed and after Sida's approval of the investigation and its recommendations. \n\nThe SRC is part of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement made up of 190 Red Cross and Red Crescent national societies, the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Federation (IFRC) and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). Sida provides support to the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement through two channels: the ICRC and the SRC. The SRC channels most of Sida's support to national societies, the IFRC and the ICRC and works in longterm partnership with forteen countries: Cameroon, DR Congo, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, DPRK, Myanmar, Iraq, Palestine, Syria, Yemen and Ukraine. \n\nThe SRC\u2019s strategic cooperation with partners within the movement - with other National Societies (NS), IFRC and the ICRC \u2013 is essential and gives the SRC the possibility to work at both global and local levels. The SRC is in addition considered to have systems, expertise and capacity to strengthen the local capacity of NS to predict and prevent disasters, as well as to contribute to rapid humanitarian assistance in sudden crises. The SRC has faced difficulties in demonstrating the humanitarian relevance of the Sida-funded programs as they are often situated between humanitarian action and long-term development. The SRC\u2019s new humanitarian strategy 2016-2019 does, however, put a greater focus on humanitarian operations and this new approach is reflected in the organisation\u2019s application 2017-2019. Several programmes with a long-term development focus have been removed in the application for funding from Sida, and new initiatives with a sharper humanitarian focus have been included, such as Yemen and Cameroon (programme targeting CAR refugees). It will be important to follow up on this positive direction towards a strengthened humanitarian relevance to the Sida-funded projects to ensure its continuation.\n\nSupport planned for 2017 includes long-term programs in various fields such as health, disaster prevention, resilience, sanitation, organizational development, volunteer development and planning, monitoring, evaluation and results (PMER). The support also includes regional support to the IFRC\u2019s different cluster- and regional offices in Africa, Asia and MENA. Thematic- and capacity enhancement support will in 2017 focus on disaster reduction, volunteering in conflict and disaster, water and sanitation, health, and gender and diversity. Through support in the form of Sida's Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM), the SRC will also be able to respond to rapid onsets of disasters. \n\nThe program proposal for 2017 includes:\nWEST- AND CENTRAL AFRICA REGIONAL SUPPORT: 1,3 MSEK\nCAMEROON: 2 MSEK\nDR CONGO: 5 MSEK \nEAST- AND SOUTH AFRICA REGIONAL SUPPORT: 2,1 MSEK\nEAST AFRICA CLUSTER (Nairobi): 2,5 MSEK\nSOMALIA: 4 MSEK \nSOUTH SUDAN: 13,5 MSEK\nSUDAN: 4 MSEK\nASIA PACIFIC REGIONAL SUPPORT: 5,8 MSEK\nAFGHANISTAN: 6,5 MSEK\nBANGLADESH: 6 MSEK\nDPRK: 4,5 MSEK\nMYANMAR: 4,5 MSEK \nMENA REGIONAL SUPPORT: 4,3 MSEK\nIRAQ: 7 MSEK\nPALESTINE: 3 MSEK\nSYRIA INCLUDING Lebanon och Jordan: 30 MSEK \nYEMEN: 4,5 MSEK \nUKRAINE: 5 MSEK\nCAPACITY- OCH METHOD SUPPORT: 7,9 MSEK \nRRM-SUPPORT: 40 MSEK\nSUPPORT FOR THE DREF: 500 000 SEK \nSPECIAL INTERVENTIONS/ICRC DELEGATES: 3,6 MSEK\n\nThe program proposal for 2018 includes:\nDR CONGO: 5 MSEK \nAFGHANISTAN: 6,5 MSEK\nMYANMAR: 4,5 MSEK \n\nThe program proposal for 2019 includes:\nDR CONGO: 5 MSEK \nAFGHANISTAN: 6,5 MSEK\nMYANMAR: 4,5 MSEK \n\nOut of Sida's initial support for 2017 totalling 167.5 MSEK, 61.4 % (103.5 MSEK) will be channelled to the IFRC and 2.6 % (4,5 MSEK) to the ICRC. Approximately 5.5 % (9.3 MSEK) consists of projects that the SRC supports in consortia and where funds are allocated through partner NS such as British, Australian and Danish Red Cross. Approximately 8.9 % (15.0 MSEK) will be channelled directly to NS (e.g., DRC and Palestinian RC, further contributions go to a number of NS for the management of SRC delegates in-country costs). Approximately 21.6 % (36.3 MSEK) out of the total budget goes directly to the SRC, of which 14.8 % (25 MSEK) for staff costs (technical delegates and program officers) and 7 % to operational support costs (11.3 MSEK).",

        "description": "The proposed programme by the Swedish Mission Council (SMC) is humanitarian and aims at meeting the humanitarian needs of affected populations in the short- and medium-term by providing emergency humanitarian support such as clean water and sanitation. In this appraisal, Sida makes the assessment that the proposed programme is relevant in relation to the Strategy for Sweden\u00b4s Humanitarian Assistance provided through Sida 2017 - 2020, and that a three-year agreement on strategic partnership should be entered into between Sida and SMC for the period 1 April 2017 - 31 March 2020.\n\nIn its proposal for 2017, SMC has applied for a total amount of 46,5 million SEK which includes 1) work in six countries (35,5 million SEK); 2) interventions through the Rapid Response Mechanism (10 million SEK); and 3) capacity development support (1 million SEK). During 2017 SMC proposes to work with four member organizations which are ADRA (Adventist Development and Relief Agency), IAS (International Aid Services), CCS (Christian Council of Sweden) and PMU (Pingsmissionens utvecklingssamarbete). \n\nSMC, founded in 1912, is an ecumenical membership-based organization with 35 member organizations who are active in 46 countries. The organization is engaged in both development work and humanitarian assistance and became a framework organization for Sida/CIVSAM already in 1980, while the strategic partnership with Sida in terms of humanitarian assistance was initiated as late as 2014. The 35 members are Swedish churches and Christian organizations with long histories of international work - the role of SMC is generally to support, facilitate and coordinate these partner organizations and their local partners\u00b4 work.",

        "description": "Somalia is ranked bottom in global indicators on gender inequality, maternal, reproductive and neonatal health and survival. One in 22 women dies every year due to pregnancy or childbirth related complications.  Neonatal deaths in children (i.e. deaths in children during the first 28 days of life) occur at a higher rate in Somalia than in any other country in the world (UNICEF 2016). Fertility in women is high with an average of 6.6 children per woman. At the same time, the incidence of gender-related violence among women including child marriages and forced marriage (more than 45 percent of girls under 18 years and one in 10 girls under 15 have been forced to marriages) and female gender mutilation (about 98 percent) are still high in the country. Women and girls have limited ability, if at all, to decide over their own bodies such when and whom to marry and when and how many children she wants and desires. Family planning still remains a difficult subject to openly discuss. Women seek these services in secrecy. \n\nUNFPA has after engagement by the embassy submitted a request to Sida for continued support to UNFPA:s country program document for the period 2011-2015, which has been formally extended until 31 December 2017. Focus for the CPD is on four key areas: 1) reproductive, maternal and neonatal health; 2) gender equality, with a special attention on SGBV; FGM and early marriage; 3) population data and statistiks; and 4) youh. Sweden has given support to UNFPA since 2014 within the framework of the previous joint health and nutrition program (JHNP) which ended in April 2017. Within the framework of JHNP, UNFPA has contributed to several important results, including: 1) training, quality assurance and registration of midwives; 2) maternal health services for pregnant women including increased access to modern contraception; 3) advocacy and community engagement in preventing female genital mutilation, child marriages, and violence against women; and 4) legal support towards for FGM and SGBV bill, both approved and adopted in Puntland region of Somalia while in federal government and in Somaliland the bills are awaiting parliament approval. UNFPA's work has a clear ownership of the Somali government and its federal administrations.\n\nIn addition to Sweden, UNFPA recieved new funding during 2017 from Finland, UK, Japan and Italy. Swedens longer-term support to UNFPA Somalia operations will be aligned with the new UNFPA Country Program Document (CPD) for the period 2018-2020, which is expected to be endorsed on the September board meeting in New York, and which will be part of the Swedens support to the UN Multi Partner Trust Fund Phase II which will be assessed during late autumn 2017.",

        "description": "Reprogrammed funds to mitigate the impact of COVID-19\nThis assessment forms the basis for a new three-year agreement between Oxfam GB and Sida to support Oxfam GB\u2019s humanitarian programme from 1 April 2018 to 31 March 2021, where additional contributions will be added to the agreement, subject to funds availability, governmental appropriations and Sida needs assessments.\n\nIn 2018, more than 135 million people will be in need of humanitarian assistance globally to a cost of 22.5 billion dollar, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). Sweden's humanitarian assistance is needs-based and Sida each year undertakes a humanitarian allocation process in which all humanitarian crises are analysed, and where the partners most relevant to respond to the identified needs are selected.\n\nA number of the identified global needs for 2018 are found in protracted and forgotten crises, and Sida believes that Oxfam GB is well positioned to respond to these needs as the organization is also working with long-term development cooperation. Moreover, Oxfam GB has extensive knowledge of the local context in all proposed projects and capacity building of local actors is central to Oxfam GB's humanitarian work. In 2018-2021, it is therefore suggested that Oxfam GB receives support for emergency lifesaving activities as well as funding for longer-term activities aimed at strengthening societies\u2019 resilience to crises and disasters.\n\nOxfam GB has in previous collaborations with Sida demonstrated that the organisation is a professional and efficient humanitarian actor, most recently in the agreements during 2011-2013 and 2014-2017. In 2016 alone, Oxfam GB managed to reach 1.2 million people with humanitarian support in the sector of WASH, 94,000 people with food security and livelihood interventions and 106,000 people with protection assistance in conflict-affected settings. In line with this, Sida believes that Oxfam GB has an added value when it comes to activities of food security and livelihoods, WASH and protection. Moreover, Sida assesses that Oxfam GB's planned projects are relevant in accordance with Sida\u2019s Humanitarian Crisis Analyses (HCA) that form the basis for the allocation of a majority of the humanitarian funds for 2018 and contribute to the achievement of the goals of the Strategy for Sweden\u2019s humanitarian aid provided through the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) 2017\u20132020. Sida therefore proposes to support Oxfam GB's humanitarian projects to a cost of 104 MSEK.\n\nIn 2018-2021, Oxfam GB plans to reach over 280,000 people in Algeria, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Iraq and Chad. The contribution will consist of four components focusing on emergency life-saving activities; multi-year resilience building projects; the possibility to respond to sudden onset or deteriorating humanitarian emergencies during the year through the Rapid Response Mechanism; as well as support to method development of cash-based programming.\n\nTwo 1-year projects are proposed to be funded with a total of 5 MSEK with the following breakdown:\n\nDemocratic Republic of Congo: 1 MSEK\nIn the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Oxfam will provide support to an INGO forum with 100 NGO members with the aim of increasing the effectiveness of humanitarian interventions through improved coordination.\n\nIraq: 4 MSEK\nIn Iraq, Sida will support a project focusing on first line emergency response. The projects will target 9,600 people and include activities of food distribution as well as distribution of non-food items and hygiene materials.\n\nFive 3-year projects are proposed to be funded with a total of 28 MSEK for 2018, 19 MSEK for 2019 and 16 MSEK for 2019 with the following breakdown:\n\nAlgeria: 15 MSEK (5+5+5 MSEK)\nIn Algeria, 126 600 Sahrawi refugees will be supported in a project focusing on improving dietary diversity and strengthening of small-scale agriculture with the aim of increasing food security in the refugee camps. To reach the planned goals of the project, Oxfam will distribute fresh vegetables and flour, conduct trainings and awareness sessions on agricultural production and introduce drought-resistant crops.\n\nCentral African Republic: 18 MSEK (10+5+3 MSEK)\nIn the Central African Republic, Oxfam will target 17,500 people with food, protection and WASH activities, together with resilience building through recovery of productive assets and strengthening of communities\u2019 conflict management capabilities. The proposed activities include distribution of agricultural kits, awareness-raising on food diversification, protection and gender themes as well as strengthening of community protection committees.\n\nChad: 18 MSEK (10+5+3 MSEK)\nThe project in Chad will target 49,087 people in a project aiming to improve access to basic social services, protection, and the restoration of livelihoods. The project activities include borehole drilling, trainings of water management committees, latrine construction and hygiene promotion. The project will also highlight issues of protection and gender-based violence through awareness raising, establishment of protection committees, mapping of care services for victims of abuses and violations and awareness raising sessions on protection issues.\n\nIraq: 12 MSEK (3+4+5 MSEK)\nIn Iraq, Sida will support a project focusing on capacity building of local humanitarian leadership with the aim of strengthening the local humanitarian response capacity. The projects will target local humanitarian actors as well as a number of local NGOs.\n\nMoreover, it is further proposed that Sida contributes with 25 million within the Rapid Response Mechanism, RRM, to enable Oxfam GB to respond to sudden onset or deteriorating humanitarian emergencies throughout the year.\n\nMoreover, in addition to funding provided directly to Oxfam GB, Sida will also support the Cash Learning Partnership (CaLP) in a 3-year intervention with a total funding of 9 MSEK (4+3+2 MSEK). CaLP is a network based on learning, knowledge sharing, networking and coordination around the appropriate and timely use of cash transfer programming (CTP) in humanitarian response. CaLP does not deliver cash transfer programmes directly. The vision of CaLP is that humanitarian assistance creates the greatest value, choice and dignity for people in crisis. CaLP has six Global Objectives: 1. Ensure sufficient funding is available for cash transfer programming. 2. Ensure cash is systematically considered as an option. 3. Build sufficient capacity for cash transfer programming. 4. Strengthen coordination. 5. Ensure the effectiveness and quality of cash transfer programming. 6. Build evidence and invest in innovation. The work of CaLP\u2019s secretariat is summarised in four strategic objectives: 1. Provide specialist capacity building services and advice. 2. Make the evidence base easily accessible, improve it and apply it through standards and tools. 3. Provide specialist support to coordinating bodies. 4. Ensure influential policy processes promote CTP and the six Global Objectives.\n\nThe support to CaLP is in line with Strategy for Sweden\u2019s humanitarian aid provided through the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) 2017\u20132020 as well as Sida\u2019s commitments to cash in the World Humanitarian Summit (WHS) and in the Grand Bargain. Sida assesses that CaLP is a key organisation to work with to reach the aims of the humanitarian strategy and that the collaboration with CaLP will benefit not only Sida but the humanitarian sector as a whole. As CaLP is not a legal body and is hosted by the Humanitarian Department of Oxfam House, it is decided to include the support to CaLP in this appraisal and in the agreement between Oxfam GB and Sida.\n\nFinally, in addition to the funding of Oxfam GB's humanitarian projects, Oxfam GB will also receive 2 MSEK in programme management costs. This is further elaborated in the budget section in this appraisal.\n\nFor a detailed overview of the project allocations, see Annex VII of the agreement (Budget summary).",

        "description": "Reprogrammed funds to mitigate the impact of COVID-19\nThis intervention builds on current ongoing Sida support to the World Bank Multi-Partner Fund for Somalia (2014-2018), decision number 2014-003041. The current Sida support to the WB-MPF focus on four areas:\n1. Enabling economic growth\n2. Effective and accountable government\n3. Urban infrastructure\n4. Analytical and technical assistance.\n\nIn September 2018, the World Bank Board of Directors approved a new four-year strategy for Somalia 2019-2022. This strategy is the first World Bank strategy for Somalia in 30 years and signals a renewed confidence and trust by the World Bank in Somalia\u00b4s road map to development. This Country Partnership Framework (CPF) is currently funded by 10 donors through the the Multi-Partner Fund modality for delivery. Sweden is the fourth biggest contributor to the fund. The MPF modality is per definition a pooled fund mechanism with is the preferred mechanism of financing in conflict and post-conflict contexts. The MPF is one of three pooled funding mechanisms in Somalia established as part of the Somalia Development and Reconstruction Facility. The MPF is administered by the World Bank and operates in close cooperation with the federal government of Somalia and the contributing donors. WB-MPF are well aligned with government priorities, as articulated in the National Development Plan (2017-2019) and together cover all eight pillars of the NDP. Hence, national ownership and alignment to principles of development effectiveness is adhered to. As Administrator of the Trust Fund, the World Bank is responsible for ensuring that the MPF and its funds are used in accordance with the administrative agreements and that recipients use MPF funds in accordance with the grant agreements.\n\nThe MPF has a specific focus support to core state functions, socioeconomic recovery and sustainable development compared with the UN Fund being more broad in scope and the AfDB focusing on rehabilitation and development of infrastructure. Sida has provided support to UN-MPTF since 2015 (decision number 2015-002435 and 2018-001376). The AFDB-SIF is currently the only funding window which Sida does not contribute. The AFDB-SIF has only started in 2017.\n\nThe overall aim of the CPF 2019-2022 is to lay foundations for the longer-term poverty reduction and inclusive growth by focusing on priority areas and constraints creating the current Somalia \"dual development trap\" created by low level of trusts and exacerbated by widespread vulnerability of repeated shocks. The strategy has two focus areas (1) Strengthening Institutions to Deliver Services and (2) Restoring Economic Resilience and Opportunities. The first focus area will strengthen ongoing governance programs with a new focus on fiscal space and improving access to - and quality of - key social services and resilience. Programs will specifically target public finance management reforms, domestic revenue mobilization and resource sharing, basic delivery systems for social services; and urban resilience. The second focus area aims to increase economic resilience as a basis for long-run poverty reduction and inclusive growth by improving business environment and lowering barriers to market entry, increasing access to finance for inclusion and digital development; and improved access to water and renewable energy. \n\nAlthough the new World Bank strategy covers the period 2019-2022, Sida proposal for support is during 2019-2020, with a total amount of 200 million SEK as well as a support to current MPF programs of 75 million SEK in 2018. Depending if and when the World Bank manage to secure additional IDA financing and if the World Bank manages to re-adjust current plans for the health sector in line with Sida recommendations, Sida will consider contributing additional funds to the MPF during 2021-2022.\n\nTo regulate Sida\u2019s commitment and conditions for supporting the Somalia MPF, Sida and the World Bank will use the 2016 template agreed in December 2016 by Consultative Group on Operational Principles for Trust Funds and Partnership (CGOP) \u201cModel Form of Administration Agreement Model Form \u2013 SDTF/MDTF\u201d. It is important for Sida to use the new administrative agreement since the new template better reflects the Swedish law on disclosure. The new agreement also includes improved language on informing donors on incidences of suspect corruption and reporting which are both priorities to Sida\u2019s line of working. The new administrative agreement template can only apply for new Trust Funds \u2013 or when all donors agree simultaneously to agree to transfer.  Given the significant legal differences between the 2016 template and the previous template currently used for the MPF, Sweden and other donors have exerted pressure to the World Bank to support processes to apply the new 2016 template for new contributions to the Somalia Multi-Partner Trust Fund. In order to accommodate the request by Sweden and other donors who would like to use the 2016 template and exploring different options, the WB has agreed to create a new Multi-Partner Trust Fund, referred to as \u2018MPF Phase 2\u2019. The structure of the MPF Phase 2 means that World Bank will continue to report externally in one consolidated MPF Report but internally there will be two systems across which the World Bank will have to manage the Somalia investment portfolio over a few years. This effectively means an increased administrative cost. Sida has in its decision valued the benefits of using the new agreement template despite the higher administrative the new trust fund entails. The present Trust Fund is valid until 2024 with possible extension of the period. Therefore, Sida finds it difficult to enter into a new multi-year contribution agreement with the current template that does not correspond to Swedish law. Moreover, more MPF donors are expected to gradually shift to the MPF Phase 2, whereby the costs for administration is expected to decline. Other donors have already expressed interest in joining the MPF 2 in the near future. Sweden will also assert its influence among donors and advocate the phasing out of the existing Trust Fund.\n\nThe World Bank will be overall responsible for implementation but the delivery model implies that 80-85% of MPF projects are recipient executed. This means that large shares of the funding to MPF will be channeled through the Federal Government of Somalia and Federal member states. The risk of using country systems in Somalia is considered high. However, the use of country systems maximizes the effectiveness of aid and can help government legitimacy and public support, strengthening the accountability between the State and its citizens. The World Bank does not have an office in Mogadishu yet, but are gradually increasing their presence in Somalia albeit the World Bank\u00b4s presence on the ground is limited, but the World Bank works closely with the Somali authorities, both at national and sub-national level. The World Bank deploys a third-Party Monitoring Agent to support the monitoring of the World Bank\u00b4s projects as well as supporting the Bank teams in understanding the risks and manage the risks. The third-party monitoring agent also provides targeted support to the government in rebuilding and strengthening their Public Financial Management systems.It is Sida\u00b4s assessment that the World Bank as the cooperation partner has routines, resources and competence to ensure adequate internal management and control.  \n\nSomalia is making good progress in core reform areas such as the establishment of the Somalia Financial Management Information System, mechanisms for fiscal transfers between the federal government and federal member states, and improved central bank oversight and supervision. To date, the government has successfully conducted two Staff Monitored Program (SMP I and II) and embarked on a third SMP. Somalia has been identified as eligible for debt relief under the Highly Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) initiative given its unsustainable debt levels. The MPF shows a good track record and results which indicates that there are positive causal links between the MPF programs and the progress that Somalia has made since the establishment of the MPF. \n\nThe WB-MPF portfolio has contributed to crucial reforms such as macroeconomic stability and building a track record for arrears clearance and debt relief. There is evidence that potential access to IFI financing, in the relatively short term, and eventual debt relief in the longer term, are proving powerful incentives for reforms, particularly in public finance management. The MPF private sector development support has been critical for business reforms and engaging the private sector. Developing the Somali private sector is imperative to Somalia\u2019s peace and prosperity, and the government and donors need to work closely with the private sector on economic growth priorities. Nevertheless, the challenges for Somalia are still daunting in many areas such as improving macro-fiscal framework, implementing crucial tax measures to raise revenue, enacting key legislation, forging a political consensus on a federal model and strengthening the capacity of key institutions. \n\nOverall risk level in Somalia:\nViolence and armed conflict as well as political instability are some of the main obstacles to economic and social development in Somalia. Apart from the political and security challenges, Somalia is in a difficult humanitarian situation. Climate change and recurring periods of drought regularly affect the population and its resilience is low after decades of conflict and instability. More concretely, the following general risks that can negatively affects the MPF programs have been identified:\n\u2022\tWorsened security situation and increased Al-Shabaab attacks that can destabilize the country.\n\u2022\tSomalia\u00b4s transition as well as clan/fraction related local conflicts.\n\u2022\tHigh level of corruption and culture of nepotism affecting MPF programs.\n\u2022\tPolitical instability due to the federalization process as well as upcoming elections (both FMS level and federal level).\n\u2022\tRecurrent natural disasters and/or conflict might disrupt the World Bank's MPF long term development interventions where donors might have to re-prioritize or re-program available funds depending on the severity of the shocks. This might affect donor contributions to the MPF and available funds to MPF, meaning less contributions to the MPF.\n\nThe appraisal memorandum has been written in English, as English-speaking personnel at the Embassy in Nairobi participate in the appraisal and follow-up of the contribution, in accordance with the General Director's decision regarding choice of language as per the instructions from 1 March 2013.",

It is important for Sida to use the new administrative agreement since the new template better reflects the Swedish law on disclosure. The new agreement also includes improved language on informing donors on incidences of suspect corruption and reporting which are both priorities to Sida\u2019s line of working. The new administrative agreement template can only apply for new Trust Funds \u2013 or when all donors agree simultaneously to agree to transfer.  Given the significant legal differences between the 2016 template and the previous template currently used for the MPF, Sweden and other donors have exerted pressure to the World Bank to support processes to apply the new 2016 template for new contributions to the Somalia Multi-Partner Trust Fund. In order to accommodate the request by Sweden and other donors who would like to use the 2016 template and exploring different options, the WB has agreed to create a new Multi-Partner Trust Fund, referred to as \u2018MPF Phase 2\u2019. The structure of the MPF Phase 2 means that World Bank will continue to report externally in one consolidated MPF Report but internally there will be two systems across which the World Bank will have to manage the Somalia investment portfolio over a few years. This effectively means an increased administrative cost. Sida has in its decision valued the benefits of using the new agreement template despite the higher administrative the new trust fund entails. The present Trust Fund is valid until 2024 with possible extension of the period. Therefore, Sida finds it difficult to enter into a new multi-year contribution agreement with the current template that does not correspond to Swedish law. Moreover, more MPF donors are expected to gradually shift to the MPF Phase 2, whereby the costs for administration is expected to decline. Other donors have already expressed interest in joining the MPF 2 in the near future. Sweden will also assert its influence among donors and advocate the phasing out of the existing Trust Fund.\n\nThe World Bank will be overall responsible for implementation but the delivery model implies that 80-85% of MPF projects are recipient executed. This means that large shares of the funding to MPF will be channeled through the Federal Government of Somalia and Federal member states. The risk of using country systems in Somalia is considered high. However, the use of country systems maximizes the effectiveness of aid and can help government legitimacy and public support, strengthening the accountability between the State and its citizens. The World Bank does not have an office in Mogadishu yet, but are gradually increasing their presence in Somalia albeit the World Bank\u00b4s presence on the ground is limited, but the World Bank works closely with the Somali authorities, both at national and sub-national level. The World Bank deploys a third-Party Monitoring Agent to support the monitoring of the World Bank\u00b4s projects as well as supporting the Bank teams in understanding the risks and manage the risks. The third-party monitoring agent also provides targeted support to the government in rebuilding and strengthening their Public Financial Management systems.It is Sida\u00b4s assessment that the World Bank as the cooperation partner has routines, resources and competence to ensure adequate internal management and control.  \n\nSomalia is making good progress in core reform areas such as the establishment of the Somalia Financial Management Information System, mechanisms for fiscal transfers between the federal government and federal member states, and improved central bank oversight and supervision. To date, the government has successfully conducted two Staff Monitored Program (SMP I and II) and embarked on a third SMP. Somalia has been identified as eligible for debt relief under the Highly Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) initiative given its unsustainable debt levels. The MPF shows a good track record and results which indicates that there are positive causal links between the MPF programs and the progress that Somalia has made since the establishment of the MPF. \n\nThe WB-MPF portfolio has contributed to crucial reforms such as macroeconomic stability and building a track record for arrears clearance and debt relief. There is evidence that potential access to IFI financing, in the relatively short term, and eventual debt relief in the longer term, are proving powerful incentives for reforms, particularly in public finance management. The MPF private sector development support has been critical for business reforms and engaging the private sector. Developing the Somali private sector is imperative to Somalia\u2019s peace and prosperity, and the government and donors need to work closely with the private sector on economic growth priorities. Nevertheless, the challenges for Somalia are still daunting in many areas such as improving macro-fiscal framework, implementing crucial tax measures to raise revenue, enacting key legislation, forging a political consensus on a federal model and strengthening the capacity of key institutions. \n\nOverall risk level in Somalia:\nViolence and armed conflict as well as political instability are some of the main obstacles to economic and social development in Somalia. Apart from the political and security challenges, Somalia is in a difficult humanitarian situation. Climate change and recurring periods of drought regularly affect the population and its resilience is low after decades of conflict and instability. More concretely, the following general risks that can negatively affects the MPF programs have been identified:\n\u2022\tWorsened security situation and increased Al-Shabaab attacks that can destabilize the country.\n\u2022\tSomalia\u00b4s transition as well as clan/fraction related local conflicts.\n\u2022\tHigh level of corruption and culture of nepotism affecting MPF programs.\n\u2022\tPolitical instability due to the federalization process as well as upcoming elections (both FMS level and federal level).\n\u2022\tRecurrent natural disasters and/or conflict might disrupt the World Bank's MPF long term development interventions where donors might have to re-prioritize or re-program available funds depending on the severity of the shocks.

        "description": "Reprogrammed funds to mitigate the impact of COVID-19\nThis intervention builds on current ongoing Sida support to the World Bank Multi-Partner Fund for Somalia (2014-2018), decision number 2014-003041. The current Sida support to the WB-MPF focus on four areas:\n1. Enabling economic growth\n2. Effective and accountable government\n3. Urban infrastructure\n4. Analytical and technical assistance.\n\nIn September 2018, the World Bank Board of Directors approved a new four-year strategy for Somalia 2019-2022. This strategy is the first World Bank strategy for Somalia in 30 years and signals a renewed confidence and trust by the World Bank in Somalia\u00b4s road map to development. This Country Partnership Framework (CPF) is currently funded by 10 donors through the the Multi-Partner Fund modality for delivery. Sweden is the fourth biggest contributor to the fund. The MPF modality is per definition a pooled fund mechanism with is the preferred mechanism of financing in conflict and post-conflict contexts. The MPF is one of three pooled funding mechanisms in Somalia established as part of the Somalia Development and Reconstruction Facility. The MPF is administered by the World Bank and operates in close cooperation with the federal government of Somalia and the contributing donors. WB-MPF are well aligned with government priorities, as articulated in the National Development Plan (2017-2019) and together cover all eight pillars of the NDP. Hence, national ownership and alignment to principles of development effectiveness is adhered to. As Administrator of the Trust Fund, the World Bank is responsible for ensuring that the MPF and its funds are used in accordance with the administrative agreements and that recipients use MPF funds in accordance with the grant agreements.\n\nThe MPF has a specific focus support to core state functions, socioeconomic recovery and sustainable development compared with the UN Fund being more broad in scope and the AfDB focusing on rehabilitation and development of infrastructure. Sida has provided support to UN-MPTF since 2015 (decision number 2015-002435 and 2018-001376). The AFDB-SIF is currently the only funding window which Sida does not contribute. The AFDB-SIF has only started in 2017.\n\nThe overall aim of the CPF 2019-2022 is to lay foundations for the longer-term poverty reduction and inclusive growth by focusing on priority areas and constraints creating the current Somalia \"dual development trap\" created by low level of trusts and exacerbated by widespread vulnerability of repeated shocks. The strategy has two focus areas (1) Strengthening Institutions to Deliver Services and (2) Restoring Economic Resilience and Opportunities. The first focus area will strengthen ongoing governance programs with a new focus on fiscal space and improving access to - and quality of - key social services and resilience. Programs will specifically target public finance management reforms, domestic revenue mobilization and resource sharing, basic delivery systems for social services; and urban resilience. The second focus area aims to increase economic resilience as a basis for long-run poverty reduction and inclusive growth by improving business environment and lowering barriers to market entry, increasing access to finance for inclusion and digital development; and improved access to water and renewable energy. \n\nAlthough the new World Bank strategy covers the period 2019-2022, Sida proposal for support is during 2019-2020, with a total amount of 200 million SEK as well as a support to current MPF programs of 75 million SEK in 2018.

        "description": "Reprogrammed funds to mitigate the impact of COVID-19\nThis intervention builds on current ongoing Sida support to the World Bank Multi-Partner Fund for Somalia (2014-2018), decision number 2014-003041. The current Sida support to the WB-MPF focus on four areas:\n1. Enabling economic growth\n2. Effective and accountable government\n3. Urban infrastructure\n4. Analytical and technical assistance.\n\nIn September 2018, the World Bank Board of Directors approved a new four-year strategy for Somalia 2019-2022. This strategy is the first World Bank strategy for Somalia in 30 years and signals a renewed confidence and trust by the World Bank in Somalia\u00b4s road map to development. This Country Partnership Framework (CPF) is currently funded by 10 donors through the the Multi-Partner Fund modality for delivery. Sweden is the fourth biggest contributor to the fund. The MPF modality is per definition a pooled fund mechanism with is the preferred mechanism of financing in conflict and post-conflict contexts. The MPF is one of three pooled funding mechanisms in Somalia established as part of the Somalia Development and Reconstruction Facility. The MPF is administered by the World Bank and operates in close cooperation with the federal government of Somalia and the contributing donors. WB-MPF are well aligned with government priorities, as articulated in the National Development Plan (2017-2019) and together cover all eight pillars of the NDP. Hence, national ownership and alignment to principles of development effectiveness is adhered to. As Administrator of the Trust Fund, the World Bank is responsible for ensuring that the MPF and its funds are used in accordance with the administrative agreements and that recipients use MPF funds in accordance with the grant agreements.\n\nThe MPF has a specific focus support to core state functions, socioeconomic recovery and sustainable development compared with the UN Fund being more broad in scope and the AfDB focusing on rehabilitation and development of infrastructure. Sida has provided support to UN-MPTF since 2015 (decision number 2015-002435 and 2018-001376). The AFDB-SIF is currently the only funding window which Sida does not contribute. The AFDB-SIF has only started in 2017.\n\nThe overall aim of the CPF 2019-2022 is to lay foundations for the longer-term poverty reduction and inclusive growth by focusing on priority areas and constraints creating the current Somalia \"dual development trap\" created by low level of trusts and exacerbated by widespread vulnerability of repeated shocks. The strategy has two focus areas (1) Strengthening Institutions to Deliver Services and (2) Restoring Economic Resilience and Opportunities. The first focus area will strengthen ongoing governance programs with a new focus on fiscal space and improving access to - and quality of - key social services and resilience. Programs will specifically target public finance management reforms, domestic revenue mobilization and resource sharing, basic delivery systems for social services; and urban resilience. The second focus area aims to increase economic resilience as a basis for long-run poverty reduction and inclusive growth by improving business environment and lowering barriers to market entry, increasing access to finance for inclusion and digital development; and improved access to water and renewable energy. \n\nAlthough the new World Bank strategy covers the period 2019-2022, Sida proposal for support is during 2019-2020, with a total amount of 200 million SEK as well as a support to current MPF programs of 75 million SEK in 2018. Depending if and when the World Bank manage to secure additional IDA financing and if the World Bank manages to re-adjust current plans for the health sector in line with Sida recommendations, Sida will consider contributing additional funds to the MPF during 2021-2022.\n\nTo regulate Sida\u2019s commitment and conditions for supporting the Somalia MPF, Sida and the World Bank will use the 2016 template agreed in December 2016 by Consultative Group on Operational Principles for Trust Funds and Partnership (CGOP) \u201cModel Form of Administration Agreement Model Form \u2013 SDTF/MDTF\u201d. It is important for Sida to use the new administrative agreement since the new template better reflects the Swedish law on disclosure. The new agreement also includes improved language on informing donors on incidences of suspect corruption and reporting which are both priorities to Sida\u2019s line of working. The new administrative agreement template can only apply for new Trust Funds \u2013 or when all donors agree simultaneously to agree to transfer.  Given the significant legal differences between the 2016 template and the previous template currently used for the MPF, Sweden and other donors have exerted pressure to the World Bank to support processes to apply the new 2016 template for new contributions to the Somalia Multi-Partner Trust Fund. In order to accommodate the request by Sweden and other donors who would like to use the 2016 template and exploring different options, the WB has agreed to create a new Multi-Partner Trust Fund, referred to as \u2018MPF Phase 2\u2019. The structure of the MPF Phase 2 means that World Bank will continue to report externally in one consolidated MPF Report but internally there will be two systems across which the World Bank will have to manage the Somalia investment portfolio over a few years. This effectively means an increased administrative cost. Sida has in its decision valued the benefits of using the new agreement template despite the higher administrative the new trust fund entails. The present Trust Fund is valid until 2024 with possible extension of the period. Therefore, Sida finds it difficult to enter into a new multi-year contribution agreement with the current template that does not correspond to Swedish law. Moreover, more MPF donors are expected to gradually shift to the MPF Phase 2, whereby the costs for administration is expected to decline. Other donors have already expressed interest in joining the MPF 2 in the near future. Sweden will also assert its influence among donors and advocate the phasing out of the existing Trust Fund.\n\nThe World Bank will be overall responsible for implementation but the delivery model implies that 80-85% of MPF projects are recipient executed. This means that large shares of the funding to MPF will be channeled through the Federal Government of Somalia and Federal member states. The risk of using country systems in Somalia is considered high. However, the use of country systems maximizes the effectiveness of aid and can help government legitimacy and public support, strengthening the accountability between the State and its citizens. The World Bank does not have an office in Mogadishu yet, but are gradually increasing their presence in Somalia albeit the World Bank\u00b4s presence on the ground is limited, but the World Bank works closely with the Somali authorities, both at national and sub-national level. The World Bank deploys a third-Party Monitoring Agent to support the monitoring of the World Bank\u00b4s projects as well as supporting the Bank teams in understanding the risks and manage the risks. The third-party monitoring agent also provides targeted support to the government in rebuilding and strengthening their Public Financial Management systems.It is Sida\u00b4s assessment that the World Bank as the cooperation partner has routines, resources and competence to ensure adequate internal management and control.  \n\nSomalia is making good progress in core reform areas such as the establishment of the Somalia Financial Management Information System, mechanisms for fiscal transfers between the federal government and federal member states, and improved central bank oversight and supervision. To date, the government has successfully conducted two Staff Monitored Program (SMP I and II) and embarked on a third SMP. Somalia has been identified as eligible for debt relief under the Highly Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) initiative given its unsustainable debt levels. The MPF shows a good track record and results which indicates that there are positive causal links between the MPF programs and the progress that Somalia has made since the establishment of the MPF. \n\nThe WB-MPF portfolio has contributed to crucial reforms such as macroeconomic stability and building a track record for arrears clearance and debt relief. There is evidence that potential access to IFI financing, in the relatively short term, and eventual debt relief in the longer term, are proving powerful incentives for reforms, particularly in public finance management. The MPF private sector development support has been critical for business reforms and engaging the private sector. Developing the Somali private sector is imperative to Somalia\u2019s peace and prosperity, and the government and donors need to work closely with the private sector on economic growth priorities. Nevertheless, the challenges for Somalia are still daunting in many areas such as improving macro-fiscal framework, implementing crucial tax measures to raise revenue, enacting key legislation, forging a political consensus on a federal model and strengthening the capacity of key institutions. \n\nOverall risk level in Somalia:\nViolence and armed conflict as well as political instability are some of the main obstacles to economic and social development in Somalia. Apart from the political and security challenges, Somalia is in a difficult humanitarian situation. Climate change and recurring periods of drought regularly affect the population and its resilience is low after decades of conflict and instability. More concretely, the following general risks that can negatively affects the MPF programs have been identified:\n\u2022\tWorsened security situation and increased Al-Shabaab attacks that can destabilize the country.\n\u2022\tSomalia\u00b4s transition as well as clan/fraction related local conflicts.\n\u2022\tHigh level of corruption and culture of nepotism affecting MPF programs.\n\u2022\tPolitical instability due to the federalization process as well as upcoming elections (both FMS level and federal level).\n\u2022\tRecurrent natural disasters and/or conflict might disrupt the World Bank's MPF long term development interventions where donors might have to re-prioritize or re-program available funds depending on the severity of the shocks. This might affect donor contributions to the MPF and available funds to MPF, meaning less contributions to the MPF.\n\nThe appraisal memorandum has been written in English, as English-speaking personnel at the Embassy in Nairobi participate in the appraisal and follow-up of the contribution, in accordance with the General Director's decision regarding choice of language as per the instructions from 1 March 2013.",

The third-party monitoring agent also provides targeted support to the government in rebuilding and strengthening their Public Financial Management systems.It is Sida\u00b4s assessment that the World Bank as the cooperation partner has routines, resources and competence to ensure adequate internal management and control.  \n\nSomalia is making good progress in core reform areas such as the establishment of the Somalia Financial Management Information System, mechanisms for fiscal transfers between the federal government and federal member states, and improved central bank oversight and supervision. To date, the government has successfully conducted two Staff Monitored Program (SMP I and II) and embarked on a third SMP. Somalia has been identified as eligible for debt relief under the Highly Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) initiative given its unsustainable debt levels. The MPF shows a good track record and results which indicates that there are positive causal links between the MPF programs and the progress that Somalia has made since the establishment of the MPF. \n\nThe WB-MPF portfolio has contributed to crucial reforms such as macroeconomic stability and building a track record for arrears clearance and debt relief. There is evidence that potential access to IFI financing, in the relatively short term, and eventual debt relief in the longer term, are proving powerful incentives for reforms, particularly in public finance management. The MPF private sector development support has been critical for business reforms and engaging the private sector. Developing the Somali private sector is imperative to Somalia\u2019s peace and prosperity, and the government and donors need to work closely with the private sector on economic growth priorities. Nevertheless, the challenges for Somalia are still daunting in many areas such as improving macro-fiscal framework, implementing crucial tax measures to raise revenue, enacting key legislation, forging a political consensus on a federal model and strengthening the capacity of key institutions. \n\nOverall risk level in Somalia:\nViolence and armed conflict as well as political instability are some of the main obstacles to economic and social development in Somalia. Apart from the political and security challenges, Somalia is in a difficult humanitarian situation. Climate change and recurring periods of drought regularly affect the population and its resilience is low after decades of conflict and instability. More concretely, the following general risks that can negatively affects the MPF programs have been identified:\n\u2022\tWorsened security situation and increased Al-Shabaab attacks that can destabilize the country.\n\u2022\tSomalia\u00b4s transition as well as clan/fraction related local conflicts.\n\u2022\tHigh level of corruption and culture of nepotism affecting MPF programs.\n\u2022\tPolitical instability due to the federalization process as well as upcoming elections (both FMS level and federal level).\n\u2022\tRecurrent natural disasters and/or conflict might disrupt the World Bank's MPF long term development interventions where donors might have to re-prioritize or re-program available funds depending on the severity of the shocks. This might affect donor contributions to the MPF and available funds to MPF, meaning less contributions to the MPF.\n\nThe appraisal memorandum has been written in English, as English-speaking personnel at the Embassy in Nairobi participate in the appraisal and follow-up of the contribution, in accordance with the General Director's decision regarding choice of language as per the instructions from 1 March 2013.",

        "description": "SPIDER was founded as a center for expertise concerning ICT for development at Sida's initiative and was initially housed by the Royal Institute of Technology and later by Stockholm University, which is Sida's agreement partner. Sida has since continued to provide a multi-year non-earmarked support to SPIDER. SPIDER acts as the Swedish operational counterpart and advisor for a number of Sida\u2019s ICT for development (ICT4D) projects in countries prioritized by Sida. SPIDER mobilizes a network of Swedish and international experts in the area of information and communications technology (ICT) for development to help developing countries use ICT as a tool to efficiently and strategically drive development and poverty reduction goals - in this case, in the area of health. The proposed initiative aims to establish a National Health Management Information System (HMIS) in Somalia. There is no such initiative currently in the country. Establishing an effective HMIS is included in WHO's six basic building blocks for health systems. Current fragmentation and lack of data and information make it difficult, if not impossible, for Somali healthcare providers to plan, manage and deliver quality healthcare across the country in a cost-effective manner.\n\nSPIDER proposes an initial 12-month start-up phase during which SPIDER will conduct a review of the current data and information situation and capacity in Somalia, analysis of regional needs, including an assessment of the health system in the two selected regions (Galmudug and Puntland), recruitment and posting of project staff and mapping of relevant stakeholder. The two selected regions were determined by SPIDER in consultation with the Federal Ministry of Health in Somalia. The two selected regions reflect the current healthcare system in Somalia. The Galmudug region represents one of the weakest health systems with limited capacity and reach. The Galumudug region is also partially controlled by Al-Shabaab, which makes it difficult to access critical maternal and child health care. The Puntland region, on the other hand, has one of the most developed health systems in Somalia's federal government. The region is quite stable, and the Ministry of Health has sufficient capacity and experience compared to Galmudug. SPIDER also proposes to create a central hub for data storage and management in Mogadishu. Lessons learned from the first introductory phase will guide decisions to scale up the initiative to other regions. In summary, the project aims to design, establish and deliver a health information management system for that is suitable for Somalia's infrastructure and public health needs. The development of HMIS is an important issue for the federal government and is included among seen health care priorities.",

        "description": "New/additional funds to address COVID-19\nSomalia is one of the fastest urbanizing countries in the world. The rapid urbanization is caused by significant forced displacements from rural areas into urban areas driven by conflicts, insecurity, search for economic opportunities and cyclical environmental adversities such as drought and famine. This has a huge impact not only upon livelihood opportunities, peace and stability and resilience, but also shifting rural and pastoralist livelihood to urban economies. The urban influx raises many challenges for the provision of basic urban services including secure access to land for settlement of IDPs and existing vulnerable communities. Lack of effective land administration and planning systems and weak institutions has led to arbitrary distribution of land and has aggravated contestation over land, housing and basic services. Intense competition over land exacerbates forced evictions particularly among IDPs and urban poor.\n\nThe focus of this programme will be to promote inclusive employment opportunities for urban vulnerable populations, increase youth participation; integration of displacement affected households and to strengthen implementation of Durable Solutions and Youth development across Somalia. The programme will be implemented in Mogadishu, Kismayo, Baidoa and Dollow which are some of the majorly affected towns/cities.",

The programme is a follow-up phase of the \"IMS-Fojo Somalia Programme 2014-2018\" which amounted to a total figure of 57 MSEK.\n\nIn order to avoid an activity gap between the first and second phase, IMS/Fojo decided to start implementing the programme from 1st of January 2019 with temporary funding from IMS headquarter. This was done with the aspiration of Swedish funding for the second phase coming through during spring 2019. The Embassy will hence fund the activities retroactively, starting from 1st of January 2019. \n\nSweden is currently the only donor.",

        "description": "Sida has assessed the UN High Commissioner for Refugees as a relevant and strategic humanitarian partner with good implementation capacity. Sida\u2019s Central Organisational Assessment of UNHCR (2015) concludes that the organisation\u2019s systems for internal control are adequate according and in line with Sida contribution regulations. \n\nSida provides support, in addition to the MFA's annual core contribution, based on the UN Consolidated Appeals (HRP) and UNHCRs Global Appeal, Supplementary Budget Appeals and UNHCR Regional Response Plans (RRRP). Sida allocates funding to UNHCR on a country / regional level and support is unearmarked at this level. During the year Sida assesses UNHCR's Supplementary Appeals for possible additional funding through supplementary decisions.\n\nWith its mandate, to protect refugees, forcibly displaced communities and stateless people, and assist in their voluntary repatriation, local integration or resettlement to a third country, UNHCR is alongside ICRC Sida\u2019s key protection partner. In addition to its operational role in the protection of refugees, UNHCR has a normative role in monitoring and interpreting the Refugee Convention. UNHCR is the lead Agency in Refugee operations within the humanitarian system with responsibility to coordinate UN agencies and NGOs response in refugee crisis. This includes coordination of several regional refugee appeals such as Syria, Horn of Africa, Nigeria, South Sudan, Yemen, CAR, Burundi and Europe.\n\nUNHCR coordinates its response under OCHA in emergency within countries (internally displaced people). UNHCR is responsible for leading and coordinating the Protection Cluster, the clusters of Camp Coordination and Camp Management, as well as the Emergency Shelter cluster. UNHCR is thereby contributing strategically to the humanitarian system, at global, regional and country level.\n\nThrough this support Sida contributes humanitarian funding to UNHCR in order to assist refugees and internally displaced people in armed conflict, providing legal protection from persecution and violence, emergency shelter (tents, semi-permanent structures, rent for temporary accommodation) and basic necessities (such as food, water, hygiene and primary health care, etc), as well as opportunities for durable solutions, when the situation so allows. \n\nThe country allocations for 2019 includes a total of 250 MSEK, including 30 MSEK to the global COVID-19 response plan.\n\nTo facilitate rapid humanitarian planning and response, disbursement the main part of the amount is made at the beginning of the year after signing of the Agreement and upon disbursement request from UNHCR. Funds are utilized within a short timeframe after disbursement and UNHCR has a general utilization rate of 98% of the annual contributions. It is Sida's experience that funds available for activities at the country level rarely reaches or exceeds UNHCR's total funding needs. The funding level for UNHCR is generally about 50% of the annual budget. In the exceptional case that UNHCR has not utilized the entire Sida contribution by the end of the year, Sida has been duly informed and the balance have been regulated in accordance with the agreement. The proposed payment plan is thus in line with Sida's rule for contribution management \u00a7 2.8.4, which stipulates that payment will be made in close connection with the time when the funds will be used, and as the funding needs arise.",

        "description": "The project aims at improving the capacity of public sector health and education institutions to provide quality services with special focus on vulnerable groups: women children and youth through skills and knowledge transfer by the Somali diaspora. The ov\nerall objective of the project is to contribute to stabilization in South Central Somalia and Puntland through increasing access to basic services (health and education) and creating employment opportunities for the youth including women. In addition young\n Somalis will be placed in internship positions under the supervision of the diaspora experts at relevant institutions. The project trains health and education sector professionals to produce quality public services in health and education and to administe\nr the resources of the sectors. The trainers are diaspora experts especially Finnish diaspora who work and share their expertise in the sectors.The Mid-Term Evaluation which was finalized in August 2018 showed that results have been gained in both health a\nnd education sectors. For example the intake of patients at Yardimeli Hospital in Mogadishu has increased significantly in a short period of time from around 800 patients in July 2017 to around 4000 in March 2018. Moreover the number of assisted births inc\nreased substantially. The diaspora experts placed at the Ministry of Education were successful in supporting the organizational reform and writing key strategic planning documents for the sector. According to the Mid-Term Evaluation the project was very re\nlevant in filling the gaps and specialized needs in the institutions. According to all participants both local and the diaspora the project was successful in producing sustainable results in skills and knowledge. The implementing partner is the Internation\nal Organisation for Migration (IOM). From 2015 to 2019 Finland has supported the project with 4 420 000 EUR. From 2019 to 2021 the total budget for the second phase funded by Finland is 5 400 000 EUR. The budget is disbursed as follows: 1 MEUR in 2019; 24 \nMEUR in 2020; 2 MEUR in 2021.",

They train the local health professionals and participate in developing strategies plans standards and curricula for health sector. Particular attention is given to women's and child hea\nlth. In the long term the project is expected to contribute to better health outcomes for Somaliland population and especially the health outcomes for women and children.The first Finnish funded MIDA project was initiated already in 2008. The project has b\neen evaluated twice and the findings suggest that the project has significantly strengthened public health institutions? ability to provide quality services in Somaliland. The findings and recommendations of evaluations have been duly notified in the plann\ning of the Finnsom IV phase: For example the project now focuses on the more remote regions in Somaliland where service provision is poorer than in the capital Hargeisa. Similarly following the recommendations the length of the assignments of diaspora expe\nrts has been increased for Phase IV.To support the implementation of the project the National Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) also implements tailored trainings for the Ministry of Health.The duration of the Phase IV is four years from March 2017 un\ntil August 2020.

The project is a continuation of the Maternal and Child Health Services Clinic ?project that the FSA has ran since 2011 in Afmadow town. Based on an agreement with the Jubaland Ministry of Health the FSA has been asked to swi\ntch its foces to more remote villages through a mobile clinic. The mobile clinic is to start its operations in 2018 depending on permission from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Finland. With this application the project plan is to continue the Mobile He\nalth Clinic through 2019-2020 a total of three years.The main development problem that the project aims to solve is the poor access to preventive and basic health care in the Afmadow area in Jubaland Somalia. The project aims to take health services close \nto remote communities where it is difficult to get access to basic healthcare and where travelling is a challenge. By curing and providing basic health services in remote locations the project contrib-utes to creating a healthier community and society with\n people who are able to work for their own livelihoods. In this context the project contributes significantly to achieving the UN?s Sustainable Development Goals. The development impact that the project strives for is to increase the wellbeing of the commu\nnities in the project area and to decrease the number of diseases and illnesses.The mobile clinic concept includes three core outputs:1. Supporting existing healthcare by providing health services in suburbs nearby villages and towns2. Providing supportive\n services in first aid family reproductive services and interventions reducing infectious diseases in the target villages3. Reducing travelling for health services from the towns as well as building the competence of the local community in health particula\nrly by giving tools and knowledge to local midwives.",

        "title": "Fighting TB in Somalia: public-private partnerships and inclusive communities",
        "description": "The project is founded on PSR's previous projects in Somalia which have developed new strategies to tackle tuberculosis (TB) ? especially in community and private sector engagement. A special focus will be placed on women and vulnerable community members: \ndisabled persons IDPs and prisoners. Tuberculosis is a central health problem in Somalia. The increase of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a global threat ? fighting against MDR-TB in Somalia benefits all countries. Another central problem is \nthe low treatment coverage rate of about 37% leaving far too many cases untreated further transmitting tuberculosis to others. The impact targets of the project are to: a) tackle multi-drug resistant tuberculosis; and b) increase the tuberculosis case dete\nction rate. The long-term objective of the project is to contribute to the reduction of the tuberculosis burden in Somalia with the following means:1. Increase the access of women and vulnerable groups to TB services (such as disabled personsIDPs and priso\nners)2. Increase TB referrals from the private sector3. Improve the quality of TB treatment in both the public and private sector4. Improve the quality of TB laboratory work.The central partners of the project are the National Tuberculosis Programmes of So\nmaliland and Somalia. PSR has a central role in developing the national tuberculosis diagnostic infrastructure in Somalia. The project will support the National TB Reference Laboratories in Somaliland and South-Central Somalia as well as will treatment of \ntuberculosis patients in 3 clinics in Hargeisa and Mogadishu. These clinics will develop innovative community public and private sector engagement models to increase case detection improve treatment quality and to increase public awareness and decrease sti\ngma/discrimination. The clinics will also provide HIV services and nutritional support for malnourished patients (with WFP).Together with the local administration the tuberculosis clinics will be transformed into health centers providing specialized tuberc\nulosis services by the end of 2022 to support integration with basic health services and sustainability after the project has ended.",

Long-lasting conflict has damaged the health sector and due to shortage of professional staff and low financial resources especially the most vulnerable people continue to str\nuggle to receive quality healthcare. Since maternal healthcare services are not widely available majority of women don?t receive any professional healthcare during pregnancy and delivery which contributes to the high rates of maternal and infant mortality.\n Maternity Clinic and Training project has supported FinSom Maternity Clinic together with the local partner VMDSO in Afgoye Somalia since 2012. The Clinic provides maternal healthcare for thousands of women and treats about 20 000 outpatients annually. Th\ne Clinic is the only one in the area operating free of cost and open 24/7. In addition to maternal health services the project aims to increase the awareness of health-related issues in the local community such as FGM HIV/AIDS provide support for the victi\nms of gender-based violence through counseling and organize training to traditional birth attendants. Long-term goal of the project is to improve women's health in Afgoye and ensure women's access to quality maternal healthcare. Main beneficiaries of the p\nroject are the women receiving maternal healthcare and counseling at the Clinic and their children. Furthermore all the outpatients receiving care at the Clinic and people participating to the awareness raising are beneficiaries of the project. This includ\nes vulnerable groups such as IDPs and disabled women. The results of the previous project phases show that the Clinic is providing vital source of quality care both to expectant mothers and other members of the community. Raising awareness about health has\n been successful and majority of pregnant women and mothers treated at the Clinic report negative attitude towards FGM. The continuation phase invests further to increase the capacity of local partner Clinic's health personnel TBAs and volunteers through t\nraining so that in the future they could take over the management of the project and secure other sources of funding.",

Greater attention will be given to the inclusion of the marginalized and women. The programme aims to achieve three outcomes: i) Outcome 1: Policy, legal and regulatory frameworks on local governance finalized: - Policy and legislative frameworks for functional, fiscal and administrative decentralization clarify the role of local governments and their relationship to federal/central and state governments, with a view to attaining improved service delivery and stability. ii) Outcome 2: Local governments\u2019 have the capacity to deliver equitable and sustainable services, promote economic development and peace:- Building on the successes and lessons from previous phases, JPLG will consolidate, harmonize and systematize, its capacity enhancement approaches \u2013 bearing in mind the different contexts under which it operates. In Somaliland, the focus will be to empower Local Government Institute (LGIs) as drivers of capacity building initiatives. In Puntland, and the new states the programme will work with the Ministries of Interior and other partner ministries to streamline capacity development initiatives while, putting in place mechanisms to operationalise the recently approved National Local Government Capacity Development Policy (see Annex 3). It will focus on supporting capacity development beyond JPLG districts and apply capacity development lessons from Puntland to boost the new FMSs and BRA. In the new federal member states, the program will build local governments\u2019 capacity to deliver equitable services, deepen stabilization and contribute to economic recovery. iii) Outcome 3: Local governments demonstrate improved engagement of citizens, with an emphasis on women and marginalized groups:-The aim of JPLG III is to promote citizen engagement, gender equity and social inclusion, through efforts to strengthen key local governance policies, structures and processes. Barriers to women\u2019s advancement in public administration, denial of opportunities for citizens, particularly traditionally marginalized individuals and groups, to take part in, and benefit from, local decision-making, all serve to undermine the principles of equal opportunity and social justice that are the bedrock of inclusive development and democratic governance \u2013 while retaining a driver of conflict.",

This project seeks to unlock the potential of Somalia\u2019s renewable energy sector. Expanding energy access in the country has the potential to increase the productivity and competitiveness of Somali businesses, contribute to alleviating poverty (both of which could lead to increased investment), improve health and education outcomes, and bolster security. Women\u2019s Economic Empowerment gives women the independence, confidence, and ability to transform their lives. There is a direct correlation between improvements in health, education, peace, and security and the eventual success of women entrepreneurs to catalyse change within their regions, clans, towns, and families. Developing women\u2019s economic empowerment and renewable energy is critical in building wealth, creating jobs, and unleashing the potential for innovation that attracts investment and helps every nation develop.",

Indeed, the state of disrepair of water and sanitation infrastructure is a major factor contributing to significant outbreaks of water-borne diseases, particularly diarrhea whose incidence rate in Somalia is 21%. The interventions proposed under this project will therefore improve the quality of life of about 175,000 people and their livestock in rural Somalia. They are articulated around the following two operational components: 1) capacity building and 2) construction / rehabilitation of water supply and sanitation infrastructure for stability and resilience that will create about 1,300 jobs. In addition, the project will promote the use of water for multiple purposes, community mobilization campaigns and awareness of health and hygiene issues will be conducted, practices of nond\u00e9f\u00e9cation in the open, through the community-led total sanitation approach will also be promoted.

This project directly contributes to Somalia\u2019s on-going recovery efforts and the measures to promote stability and inclusion through investment in strengthening the public works institutions towards effective delivery of basic services. It will improve the capacities of MPWR&H and State-level Authorities responsible for public works to enable them to independently plan, manage and oversee infrastructure construction projects and maintenance works. The former includes the ability of Public Works Authorities to work with all relevant stakeholders and ensure the involvement of local communities and other marginalized groups (e.g. women and the youth). The enhanced and certified expertise of youth achieved through the project\u2019s activities will lead to an increase of employment in the sector, result in higher household incomes and help rebuilt the country. The outlined project will help pave the way for a well capacitated and sovereign Somali government.",

It consists of two broad components namely: (i) strengthening domestic revenue mobilization and public financial management; and (ii) advancing financial sector development. The operation has been designed in anticipation of Somalia\u2019s arrears clearance, a process being undertaken by the United Kingdom (UK). It takes into account the need for the Bank to step up its re-engagement with Somalia, post-arrears clearance, and to support the country\u2019s on-going economic and financial reforms. The implementation of the reforms being supported by the program is expected to lead to high, sustainable and inclusive growth for Somalia.

The high-risk groups are 2.4 million children under age 5 and more than 3 million women of child-bearing age. Ac\ncording to WHO the maternal mortality ratio is 732 per 100 000 live births although most of the maternal deaths would be preventable. Rebuilding the health sector is challenged by a shortage of professional staff financial resources and effective governanc\ne and NGOs have played a key role in providing with these services. African Cares Maternity Clinic and Training project has since its start in 2012 supported the development of the FinSom maternity clinic together with the local partner VMDSO. Results show\n that the service of the clinic has decreased maternal mortality rate prevalence of tetanus raised awareness about exclusive breast feeding and FGM. The clinic is well-known in Afgoye and surrounding areas and a vital source of quality maternal health care\n for both expectant mothers and the community. Hence the maternal health care services are continued also in the continuation phase of the project.The project at hand seeks to further enhance the capacity and services of the partner and the clinic so that \neventually maternal health services could be provided without development cooperation funding. This is done by investing in the education and training of the VMDSO staff and health workers and monitoring the long-term impact of the trainings. Simultaneousl\ny invaluable information on the key challenges and development needs will be mapped out and used for future trainings.  Also the support of the sexual violence victims will be intensified. It will be expanded to an in-person counselling in addition to the \ntelephone support. Open-access seminars and family counselling are likewise continued and further intensified. Seminars about gender equality family planning and gender-based violence work to dismantle unequal social structures through open dialogue. Proje\nct's beneficiaries are women in labour children victims of sexual violence clinics personnel and partner organization VMDSO.",

        "description": "The project aims at improving the capacity of public sector health and education institutions to provide quality services with special focus on vulnerable groups: women children and youth through skills and knowledge transfer by the Somali diaspora. The ov\nerall objective of the project is to contribute to stabilization in South Central Somalia and Puntland through increasing access to basic services (health and education) and creating employment opportunities for the youth including women. In addition young\n Somalis will be placed in internship positions under the supervision of the diaspora experts at relevant institutions. The project trains health and education sector professionals to produce quality public services in health and education and to administe\nr the resources of the sectors. The trainers are diaspora experts especially Finnish diaspora who work and share their expertise in the sectors.The Mid-Term Evaluation which was finalized in August 2018 showed that results have been gained in both health a\nnd education sectors. For example the intake of patients at Yardimeli Hospital in Mogadishu has increased significantly in a short period of time from around 800 patients in July 2017 to around 4000 in March 2018. Moreover the number of assisted births inc\nreased substantially. The diaspora experts placed at the Ministry of Education were successful in supporting the organizational reform and writing key strategic planning documents for the sector. According to the Mid-Term Evaluation the project was very re\nlevant in filling the gaps and specialized needs in the institutions. According to all participants both local and the diaspora the project was successful in producing sustainable results in skills and knowledge. The implementing partner is the Internation\nal Organisation for Migration (IOM). From 2015 to 2019 Finland has supported the project with 4 420 000 EUR. From 2019 to 2021 the total budget for the second phase funded by Finland is 5 400 000 EUR. The budget is disbursed as follows: 1 MEUR in 2019; 24 \nMEUR in 2020; 2 MEUR in 2021.",

        "description": "Support to the UN Population Fund's (UNFPA) country programme continues Finland's strong contribution for the development of Somalia's reproductive maternal and child health care services. UNFPA has been among the three UN agencies that have been involved \nin the UN Joint Nutrition and Health Programme in Somalia (JHNP) which focused on the development of maternal and child health services. Finland supported the implementation of the programme for 15.5MEUR between 2014-2016. JHNP has provided services for an\n area covering half of Somalia's population. It has reached good results having significantly contributed to the reduction of maternal and infant mortality. Through JHNP UNFPA has supported the provision of maternal sexual and reproductive health services \nas well as contributed to improving their quality. UNFPA has supported the running of 135 maternal clinics; the training of midwifes in 15 midwiferies throughout Somalia; the provision of training on reproductive health for over 600 health care professiona\nls; as well as the provision of technical assistance to the ministries of health to support their capacity building including their work on health sector strategic development. As JHNP is coming to an end in early-2017 UNFPA continues the work to develop t\nhe reproductive maternal and child health care in Somalia according to its mandate.UNFPA country strategy for Somalia for 2011-2016 has been extended for one year to cover also 2017. Its overall objective is to improve the wellbeing of Somali people. The c\nountry strategy aims to achieve this through reducing maternal mortality and through supporting the realization of reproductive rights and services. In addition the strategy supports gender equality and combats gender-based violence as well as strengthens \nthe Somali statistical systems and promotes evidence-based planning and policy design.Three particular priority areas have been identified for 2017:1.Increased provision of comprehensive sexual and reproductive health services (around 50% of the annual bud\nget for 2017)2.Promotion of gender equality and prevention of gender-based violence (around 25% of the 2017 budget)3.Strengthened national capacity on use of quality disaggregated data for evidence-based planning and policy design on population and develop\nment issues (around 25% of the 2017 budget)Finland supports the implementation of the UNFPA Somalia country strategy for 2011-2017 for 2 million euros.",

A special focus will be placed on women and vulnerable community members: d\nisabled persons IDPs and prisoners. Tuberculosis is a central health problem in Somalia. The increase of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a global threat  fighting against MDR-TB in Somalia benefits all countries. Another central problem is th\ne low treatment coverage rate of about 37% leaving far too many cases untreated further transmitting tuberculosis to others. The impact targets of the project are to: a) tackle multi-drug resistant tuberculosis; and b) increase the tuberculosis case detect\nion rate. The long-term objective of the project is to contribute to the reduction of the tuberculosis burden in Somalia with the following means:1. Increase the access of women and vulnerable groups to TB services (such as disabled personsIDPs and prisone\nrs)2. Increase TB referrals from the private sector3. Improve the quality of TB treatment in both the public and private sector4. Improve the quality of TB laboratory work.The central partners of the project are the National Tuberculosis Programmes of Soma\nliland and Somalia. PSR has a central role in developing the national tuberculosis diagnostic infrastructure in Somalia. The project will support the National TB Reference Laboratories in Somaliland and South-Central Somalia as well as will treatment of tu\nberculosis patients in 3 clinics in Hargeisa and Mogadishu. These clinics will develop innovative community public and private sector engagement models to increase case detection improve treatment quality and to increase public awareness and decrease stigm\na/discrimination. The clinics will also provide HIV services and nutritional support for malnourished patients (with WFP).Together with the local administration the tuberculosis clinics will be transformed into health centers providing specialized tubercul\nosis services by the end of 2022 to support integration with basic health services and sustainability after the project has ended.",

Ac\ncording to WHO the maternal mortality ratio is 732 per 100 000 live births although most of the maternal deaths would be preventable. Rebuilding the health sector is challenged by a shortage of professional staff financial resources and effective governanc\ne and NGOs have played a key role in providing with these services. African Care?s Maternity Clinic and Training project has since its start in 2012 supported the development of the FinSom maternity clinic together with the local partner VMDSO. Results sho\nw that the service of the clinic has decreased maternal mortality rate prevalence of tetanus raised awareness about exclusive breast feeding and FGM. The clinic is well-known in Afgoye and surrounding areas and a vital source of quality maternal health car\ne for both expectant mothers and the community. Hence the maternal health care services are continued also in the continuation phase of the project.The project at hand seeks to further enhance the capacity and services of the partner and the clinic so that\n eventually maternal health services could be provided without development cooperation funding. This is done by investing in the education and training of the VMDSO staff and health workers and monitoring the long-term impact of the trainings. Simultaneous\nly invaluable information on the key challenges and development needs will be mapped out and used for future trainings.  Also the support of the sexual violence victims will be intensified. It will be expanded to an in-person counselling in addition to the\n telephone support. Open-access seminars and family counselling are likewise continued and further intensified.

The ov\nerall objective of the project is to contribute to stabilization in South Central Somalia and Puntland through increasing access to basic services (health and education) and creating employment opportunities for the youth including women. In addition young\n Somalis will be placed in internship positions under the supervision of the diaspora experts at relevant institutions. The project trains health and education sector professionals to produce quality public services in health and education and to administe\nr the resources of the sectors. The trainers are diaspora experts especially Finnish diaspora who work and share their expertise in the sectors.The Mid-Term Evaluation which was finalized in August 2018 showed that results have been gained in both health a\nnd education sectors. For example the intake of patients at Yardimeli Hospital in Mogadishu has increased significantly in a short period of time from around 800 patients in July 2017 to around 4000 in March 2018. Moreover the number of assisted births inc\nreased substantially. The diaspora experts placed at the Ministry of Education were successful in supporting the organizational reform and writing key strategic planning documents for the sector. According to the Mid-Term Evaluation the project was very re\nlevant in filling the gaps and specialized needs in the institutions. According to all participants both local and the diaspora the project was successful in producing sustainable results in skills and knowledge.

The overall objective is to contribute to the reduction of TB burden and suffering in Somalia. The immediate objectives of the project include 1) To increase TB awareness and \nparticipation of communities in TB control. 2) To increase TB awareness and participation of private practitioners and pharmacists in TB control in. 3) To diagnose and treat patients at two TB centers according to WHO's DOTS protocol. 4) To provide TB cult\nure services and drug susceptibility tests (DST) for suspected MDR cases.Regarding the cross-cutting themes the project will empower women and facilitate their access to TB services. In addition the project will reduce inequality by providing an access to \nTB services for internally displaced persons (IDPs). When it comes to climate proofing there are no negative impacts on environment. For example thanks to community DOTS there will be less daily traveling to TB Centers.The main project partners include NGO\n called PSR and National TB Programs (NTPs). LSV will strengthen their capacity in all the fields described above.The main beneficiaries include local people of Hargeisa Mogadishu and nomads living in nearby areas who have TB or belong to risk groups. The \nproject will help the poorest of the poor. For example many cases are found among people who suffer from malnutrition.",

UNFPA has been among the three UN agencies that have been involved \nin the UN Joint Nutrition and Health Programme in Somalia (JHNP) which focused on the development of maternal and child health services. Finland supported the implementation of the programme for 15.5MEUR between 2014-2016. JHNP has provided services for an\n area covering half of Somalia's population. It has reached good results having significantly contributed to the reduction of maternal and infant mortality. Through JHNP UNFPA has supported the provision of maternal sexual and reproductive health services \nas well as contributed to improving their quality. UNFPA has supported the running of 135 maternal clinics; the training of midwifes in 15 midwiferies throughout Somalia; the provision of training on reproductive health for over 600 health care professiona\nls; as well as the provision of technical assistance to the ministries of health to support their capacity building including their work on health sector strategic development. As JHNP is coming to an end in early-2017 UNFPA continues the work to develop t\nhe reproductive maternal and child health care in Somalia according to its mandate.UNFPA country strategy for Somalia for 2011-2016 has been extended for one year to cover also 2017. Its overall objective is to improve the wellbeing of Somali people. The c\nountry strategy aims to achieve this through reducing maternal mortality and through supporting the realization of reproductive rights and services. In addition the strategy supports gender equality and combats gender-based violence as well as strengthens \nthe Somali statistical systems and promotes evidence-based planning and policy design.Three particular priority areas have been identified for 2017:1.Increased provision of comprehensive sexual and reproductive health services (around 50% of the annual bud\nget for 2017)2.Promotion of gender equality and prevention of gender-based violence (around 25% of the 2017 budget)3.Strengthened national capacity on use of quality disaggregated data for evidence-based planning and policy design on population and develop\nment issues (around 25% of the 2017 budget)Finland supports the implementation of the UNFPA Somalia country strategy for 2011-2017 for 2 million euros.",

The project is executed by the Finland-Somalia Association (FSA) with partner NGO SAHDA and th\ne Jubaland Ministry of Health. The project is a continuation of the Maternal and Child Health Services Clinic ?project that the FSA has ran since 2011 in Afmadow town. Based on an agreement with the Jubaland Ministry of Health the FSA has been asked to swi\ntch its foces to more remote villages through a mobile clinic. The mobile clinic is to start its operations in 2018 depending on permission from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Finland. With this application the project plan is to continue the Mobile He\nalth Clinic through 2019-2020 a total of three years.The main development problem that the project aims to solve is the poor access to preventive and basic health care in the Afmadow area in Jubaland Somalia. The project aims to take health services close \nto remote communities where it is difficult to get access to basic healthcare and where travelling is a challenge. By curing and providing basic health services in remote locations the project contrib-utes to creating a healthier community and society with\n people who are able to work for their own livelihoods. In this context the project contributes significantly to achieving the UN?s Sustainable Development Goals. The development impact that the project strives for is to increase the wellbeing of the commu\nnities in the project area and to decrease the number of diseases and illnesses.The mobile clinic concept includes three core outputs:1. Supporting existing healthcare by providing health services in suburbs nearby villages and towns2. Providing supportive\n services in first aid family reproductive services and interventions reducing infectious diseases in the target villages3. Reducing travelling for health services from the towns as well as building the competence of the local community in health particula\nrly by giving tools and knowledge to local midwives.",

        "description": "The project is founded on PSR's previous projects in Somalia which have developed new strategies to tackle tuberculosis (TB) ? especially in community and private sector engagement. A special focus will be placed on women and vulnerable community members: \ndisabled persons IDPs and prisoners. Tuberculosis is a central health problem in Somalia. The increase of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a global threat ? fighting against MDR-TB in Somalia benefits all countries. Another central problem is \nthe low treatment coverage rate of about 37% leaving far too many cases untreated further transmitting tuberculosis to others. The impact targets of the project are to: a) tackle multi-drug resistant tuberculosis; and b) increase the tuberculosis case dete\nction rate. The long-term objective of the project is to contribute to the reduction of the tuberculosis burden in Somalia with the following means:1. Increase the access of women and vulnerable groups to TB services (such as disabled personsIDPs and priso\nners)2. Increase TB referrals from the private sector3. Improve the quality of TB treatment in both the public and private sector4. Improve the quality of TB laboratory work.The central partners of the project are the National Tuberculosis Programmes of So\nmaliland and Somalia. PSR has a central role in developing the national tuberculosis diagnostic infrastructure in Somalia. The project will support the National TB Reference Laboratories in Somaliland and South-Central Somalia as well as will treatment of \ntuberculosis patients in 3 clinics in Hargeisa and Mogadishu. These clinics will develop innovative community public and private sector engagement models to increase case detection improve treatment quality and to increase public awareness and decrease sti\ngma/discrimination. The clinics will also provide HIV services and nutritional support for malnourished patients (with WFP).Together with the local administration the tuberculosis clinics will be transformed into health centers providing specialized tuberc\nulosis services by the end of 2022 to support integration with basic health services and sustainability after the project has ended.",

Somalia President Mohamed Abdullahi Farmajo declared the drought a national disaster on 28 February 2017.\nDrought affected families are resorting to a range of negative coping strategies including reducing the number of meals eaten in a given day, skipping meals, accumulation of debts or obtaining food on credit from shops, as well as migration in search of livelihood. IDPs rely heavily on support from the host community. Besides, the maternal mortality rate for Somalia is among the highest in the world at 732 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births. Water shortage may also trigger further outbreak of water borne diseases.\nOxfam provides integrated EFSVL (Emergency Food Security and Vulnerable Livelihoods) and WASH (Water, Sanitation and Hygiene) support to vulnerable women, men, boys and girls affected by drought in Sool, Sanaag, Toghdeer and Awdal regions as an immediate life saving intervention whilst taking steps to ensure the response contributes to the capacity building and resilience of communities and partners. Gender and protection will be mainstreamed throughout the response. The key EFSVL interventions include the distribution of cash grants to households who have lost their livestock and financial support to the Ministry of Livestock for scale upof livestock mass vaccination, control of parasites, disease surveillance and treatment of clinical cases. The key WASH interventions include the protection and development of spring and shallow wells, provision of water supply through trucking and vouchers, construction of communal latrines, hygiene promotion activities and distribution of hygiene materials.",

At HH and group level, the program will continue to expand the number of VSLAs, increasing the number of these social capital-developing and integration-promoting mechanisms.  Through the intensive GCVCA facilitated assessment process and subsequent development of CAAPs, SomReP will continue to place the community at the forefront of analyzing their own challenges and opportunities, and putting forth their own priorities and plans to help them better plan for and mitigate against shocks and promote food security and economic development.  The CAAP is the foundation for development planning at the community level, assisting community leadership to identify and prioritize development actions. Other organizations and consortia are also developing plans at community and district level; as such, SomReP will continue to jointly plan and coordinate actions at both Technical Unit and site level so as to ensure efficient use of multipledonors# resources in fulfillment of community needs.\nIn partnership with district and Member State line ministries, SomReP will undertake sector specific assessments targeting systems (e.g. water systems, market systems) which affect resilience buildingwithin and between villages.  During times of shock, SomReP will mobilize resources to partner with relevant line ministries to undertake assessment to support early response and post-shock recovery.  Village and village-cluster plans will be aggregated and support the development of district-level planning frameworks.  Through direct support to line ministries through secondments and other facilitative actions, the program will promote understanding of national and Member State Level frameworks (NDP andRRF) at the community planning level.  As Member State line ministries are supported to monitor uptake and progress towards achieving disaster risk management actions at community level, the government will both fulfill its mandate and begin to strengthen its ability to do this independently.",

The reduction in the number of people in need since early 2018 has been attributed to favourable rainfall during the Gu season (April to June) and sustained humanitarian assistance. Over 1.5 million people face acute food security Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or higher) and approximately 3.1 million people are Stressed (IPC 2)1. Although the 2016/2017 drought has ended in most parts of Somalia, its adverse impact lingers among those who were impoverished or displaced, and pastoralists who lost all or most of their livestock, particularly in the north. Without sustained food and livelihood assistance, the latter are likely to remain in Emergency (IPC 4).\nWhile acute malnutrition rates have improved nationally to Serious from Critical, the overall prevalence of acute malnutrition remains largely unchanged from Deyr 2017/2018. Between August and December, 294,000 acutely malnourished children, including 55,000 severe cases, aged underfive, will require treatment and integrated support. The acute malnutrition burden over the next 12 months is projected to be 588,400 acutely malnourished children, including 110,500 severe cases. The persistently high levels of acute malnutrition are unlikely toreduce without addressing the underlying causes, particularly in internally displaced persons (IDP) settlements and in some rural areas",

Training and provision ofveterinary start-up kits for 40 Community Animal Health Workers will benefit 3.600 households for treatment of their livestock.\nIn the WASH component of the action these communities directly benefit from a comprehensive package of immediate access to safe water, sanitation facilities and improved hygiene practices, including Cash for Water for 3 months for 1.760 of the most vulnerable households, improved storage capacity by provision of 16 communal water tanks, 2 jerry cans per household, and 420 emergency latrines for 4.167 HH (25.002 people), improved access to water by provision of fuel for 5 strategic borehole generators for 3 months, and maintenance of the boreholes will benefit 25.000 individuals (4.167 HH). To promote a safe water chain, Oxfam will distribute water treatment tablets for 3 months to cash for water recipients through hygiene promotion activities, for point of use household water treatment, with a focus on community engagement and participation. This will be accompanied by promotion of the adoption of good hygiene practices. Oxfam will also focus on community engagement initiatives including action planning, periodic review meetings on progress and programme processes, as well to obtain community feedback on the implementation modalities. Community volunteers will be trained on safe water chain, transmission route of water and sanitation related diseases, and preparation of oral rehydration solution (ORS) to promote adoption of good hygiene practices and manage dehydration amongst communities.\nAll this will be further supported throughprotection interventions. An ongoing protectionanalysis will ensure that activities can adapt to changes in the protection situation, that protection trend information can be shared with appropriate stakeholders, and that advocacy can be carried out where appropriate and necessary. Information on protection and existing services will be disseminated to women and men in target communities so that they are able to make informed decisions when faced with a protection threat or issue.

Training and provision ofveterinary start-up kits for 40 Community Animal Health Workers will benefit 3.600 households for treatment of their livestock.\nIn the WASH component of the action these communities directly benefit from a comprehensive package of immediate access to safe water, sanitation facilities and improved hygiene practices, including Cash for Water for 3 months for 1.760 of the most vulnerable households, improved storage capacity by provision of 16 communal water tanks, 2 jerry cans per household, and 420 emergency latrines for 4.167 HH (25.002 people), improved access to water by provision of fuel for 5 strategic borehole generators for 3 months, and maintenance of the boreholes will benefit 25.000 individuals (4.167 HH). To promote a safe water chain, Oxfam will distribute water treatment tablets for 3 months to cash for water recipients through hygiene promotion activities, for point of use household water treatment, with a focus on community engagement and participation. This will be accompanied by promotion of the adoption of good hygiene practices. Oxfam will also focus on community engagement initiatives including action planning, periodic review meetings on progress and programme processes, as well to obtain community feedback on the implementation modalities. Community volunteers will be trained on safe water chain, transmission route of water and sanitation related diseases, and preparation of oral rehydration solution (ORS) to promote adoption of good hygiene practices and manage dehydration amongst communities.\nAll this will be further supported throughprotection interventions. An ongoing protectionanalysis will ensure that activities can adapt to changes in the protection situation, that protection trend information can be shared with appropriate stakeholders, and that advocacy can be carried out where appropriate and necessary. Information on protection and existing services will be disseminated to women and men in target communities so that they are able to make informed decisions when faced with a protection threat or issue. WaSH and EFSL community committees and volunteers will be trained on protection risk analysis, and on how to receive and transmit protection information responsibly. A totalof 3.500 households will benefit from better information and a improved programming as a result.'",

        "description": "Somalia has experienced recurrent droughts since 2011 which have been increasingly exacerbated by climate change. Agro-pastoralistsand pastoralists have been badly affected by the 2019 drought which has caused widespread crop failure, water shortages, and depleted livestock levels.\nMore than 4.2 million people were estimated to be in need of humanitarian assistance in 2019, and the number ofpeople who are food insecure is expected to increase in the coming months.  This year#s severe drought has been caused by abnormally hot, dry conditions during January-March and the failure of the rains in April-June. Most households are already adopting negativecoping strategies to mitigate food insecurity, including reducing food intake. Poor transportation and market infrastructure make it difficult for pastoralists to access markets, and there are few fed markets to provide animals with nutrition when natural pastures are inadequate. Over 80% of livestock was lost as a result of the 2017 drought, and the population of livestock herds, essential for pastoralists# food and income, have not yet recovered.\nThe impact of the 2019 drought on the water and sanitation sector has beensignificant. Water supply (boreholes, shallow wells) is severely limited and the cost of accessing water has increased sharply, representing a severe burden on insufficient household income. Existing groundwater sources contain a highly mineralized content, rendering it unsuitable for drinking, but a prior Oxfam needs assessment showed that the vast majority of households in the project area do not treat their water. Open defecation remains common, increasing protection risks for women and girls who venture outside alone or during the night or move far from dwellings to known open defecation areas.\nOxfam aims to assist at least 500,000 affected peoplewith immediate food security and WASH programming along with resilience and recovery interventions to diminish the impact of recurring droughts on vulnerable populations. Oxfam will embed activities to strengthen the protection of women, men, boys, and girls within the EFSVL and WASH workstreams.",

Humanitarian response focuses on WaSH, EVFSL and Protection.\nOxfam has made a lot of gains through humanitarian resilience programmes which are likely to be eroded if the desert locust menace is uncontrolled. Oxfam will therefore capitalise and work with the existing community structures such as Early Warning Committees, Government line ministries, FAO and other stakeholders on the preventive and control measures.\nOxfam will prioritize safeguarding livelihoods focusing on cash intervention and locust control measures.\n\nA total of 1,056 people in coastal areas of Sool region will be reachedby the project and supported toprotect and recover their livelihoods.\n\nOxfam has vast experience in implementing conditional and unconditional cash transfer approaches in WASH, EVFSL programmes. The project will specifically focus on the Cash for Work(CfW) approach as it not only empowers individuals to spend based on their priority needs but also focuses on revamping community assets. CfW will therefore stimulate the recovery of the local economy by creating short-term work, reintroduce income flow,supporting local businesses through the purchase worktools while also encouraging households to purchase food and non-food items locally. The trench digging will involve large numbers of the population and will be designed to encourage the integration and participation of women and other marginalized groups in an area thus benefitting the entire community and not just a few individuals.\n\nThe project will support communities to address locust spread by burying them in trenches excavated through cash for work. A total of 1,056 people will dig 26 km of trenches and drive hopper bands through cash for work, this task will continue for 30 days, 15 days per month starting in mid-March 2020. This task is expected to minimize hopper bands probability to turn to dangerous swarm level while at the same time communities will be able to access cash to help them address food insecurity situation at household level.\n\nOxfam will closely cooperate with the Somaliland Ministry of agriculture",

        "description": "On 2nd February 2020 the Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation of the Federal Government of Somalia has declared a national emergency (see press statement in attachment) in view of the current Desert Locust upsurge that poses a major threat to Somalia#sfragile food security situation. Food sources for people and their livestock are at risk. The Desert Locust swarms are uncommonly large and consume huge amounts of crops and forage.\nAccording to locust office of the Ministry of Agriculture and HADMA  latest report, there were huge swarm of Desert locust from Yemen that at the end September 2019 laid eggs in many locations in Somaliland. Despite controlefforts, a serious and widespread desert locust outbreak is threatening crops and pasture across Northern Somali regions. Accordingto experts, this is the worst outbreak in over 25 years in Somalia.\n\nThe situation has rapidly deteriorated in January 2020, as weather conditions have been unusually conductive to the spread of the pest. After cyclone Pawanmade landfall in early December 2019, flooding across the Horn of Africa created favourable breeding conditions for desert locusts. These conditions allow the breeding until June 2020 and could lead to 500 times more locust with the formation of large numbers of swarm as FAO indicated in their latest Appeal .\nDesert Locust breeding is ongoing in Somaliland, Puntland and Galmudug (Mudug). An estimated 70,000 hectares of land has been invaded by hoppers and breeding adults. Once they mature the locusts areexpected to migrate in swarms and move south towards the Ethiopian border area of Somaliland as well as Jubaland, Southwest State and Hirshabelle. These swarms will be at their most destructive stage and pose a very severe risk to Deyr season food and fodder production.\nMating adults, hoppers and swarms have been detected in Northwest Somalia (between Bulhar and Silil). Hoppers and immature adults were reported on the Northwest plateau and a swarm was detected between Burao and the Ethiopian border. Hopper bands were also reported south of Bossaso, south of Las Anod (near the Ethiopian border) and in Galmudug (near Galkayo). More swarms are likely to form along the Northwest coast and plateau, which may migrate to Djibouti, Eastern Ethiopia and SouthernSomalia.\nCrop and pastures have already been damaged in Somalia impacting negatively onagropastoral and pastoral households. In December 2019, it was reported that a huge number of desert locust (still at the stage of hopper bands) hatched in differentbreeding areas of Somaliland, such as coastal areas and farming land, posing a new devastating threat to crops and pasture lands.",

Toll-free Covid-19 helplines our partner Shaqodoon is running in the Ministries of Health in Somaliland and Puntland have been launched in mid-April and beginnning of May respectively. The call centres utilize an interactive voice response system providing up to date information related to Covid-19 to the community. People can call the hotline and receive WHO-approved pre-recorded messages on COVID-19, check symptoms, and also talk to a healthofficers if they wish to doso. They can also leave a voicemail and will be called back. The system can be accessed free of charge through mobile phones for callers using a 3-digit shortcode.\nThe Somaliland hotline has registered more than 651,366 callsso far (as of 19 May), highlighting the thirst of people across Somaliland for accurate and reliable information on Covid-19.  A number of risk cases have been identifiedthrough the helplines already, and people tested as a result of their call and guidance received. Shaqodoon is highlighting common misinformation on Covid-19 gathered through calls as well as stats on calls, follow-up and regional origin of callers on dashboards which support the Ministry of Health and humanitarian partners in addressing needs in a timely manner. They also produce weekly dashboards to provide the Ministry of Health with an overview of calls, levels of (mis-)information per region and necessary follow-up.\n\nThis project would support Shaqodoon in extending the helpline service in collaboration with the Ministries of Health for another 2months until June/July, reaching a majority of the population in Puntland and Somaliland (at least 60% of the population) with accurate and timely information, guidance and symptoms checking, while at the same time ensuring call center staff and Ministry of Health officials receive adequate protection and safe programming support to deal with sensitive data and critical cases.  Their work will be accompanied by the installment of innovative hands-free handwashing stations designed and produced in the TVET centres of partner Havoyoco. These measures will reach another 30,000 people across Somaliland.",

Toll-free Covid-19 helplines our partner Shaqodoon is running in the Ministries of Health in Somaliland and Puntland have been launched in mid-April and beginnning of May respectively. The call centres utilize an interactive voice response system providing up to date information related to Covid-19 to the community. People can call the hotline and receive WHO-approved pre-recorded messages on COVID-19, check symptoms, and also talk to a healthofficers if they wish to doso. They can also leave a voicemail and will be called back. The system can be accessed free of charge through mobile phones for callers using a 3-digit shortcode.\nThe Somaliland hotline has registered more than 651,366 callsso far (as of 19 May), highlighting the thirst of people across Somaliland for accurate and reliable information on Covid-19.  A number of risk cases have been identifiedthrough the helplines already, and people tested as a result of their call and guidance received. Shaqodoon is highlighting common misinformation on Covid-19 gathered through calls as well as stats on calls, follow-up and regional origin of callers on dashboards which support the Ministry of Health and humanitarian partners in addressing needs in a timely manner. They also produce weekly dashboards to provide the Ministry of Health with an overview of calls, levels of (mis-)information per region and necessary follow-up.\n\nThis project would support Shaqodoon in extending the helpline service in collaboration with the Ministries of Health for another 2months until June/July, reaching a majority of the population in Puntland and Somaliland (at least 60% of the population) with accurate and timely information, guidance and symptoms checking, while at the same time ensuring call center staff and Ministry of Health officials receive adequate protection and safe programming support to deal with sensitive data and critical cases.  Their work will be accompanied by the installment of innovative hands-free handwashing stations designed and produced in the TVET centres of partner Havoyoco. These measures will reach another 30,000 people across Somaliland.",

        "description": "# Solarization of two existing water sources   in Baki and Saylac districts of Awdal benefiting more than 10,000 people and their livestock. Awdal is one of the regions affected by COVID19 as it connects Somaliland to Djibouti. The majority of people are dependent pity trades, small scale irrigation, and livestock, most of these activities have been affected, and communities reported a reduction of income. Existing water supply sources are mainly powered by a diesel generator that are purchased from the tariffs collected from the users. Associated water tariffs are sky rocking as access to diesel has reduced as restrictions are imposed on public transport. Out of the many strategic water sources, two sources are selected, supplying water for villages affected by COVID19 in Somaliland. Oxfam will install a solar system for these wells, and the action will reduce the cost of water tariff and increase community use of water for different purposes include handwashing.\n# Build the capacity of the WASH committees managing the solarizedse water sources by providing necessary tools and training them on both technical skill and financial management. This action will be led by the ministry of water department of scheme management. As we mobilize for the two sources an additional two boreholes within the sameareas will also be invited for the training. These will help to maximize use of expert time, cover nearby villages with capacity building plan and increase value for money by targeting more with same budget.\n# Support Somaliland Ministry of Water Development to ministry of water to finalize   the design and construction for WASH facilities to be shared with all WASH Cluster members in Somaliland. The national WASH cluster has prioritized this action as per the request from ministry and Oxfam will contribute for this action. The budget will be used to cover some of the consultancy fees or provide expertise to help them finalize the work.\n# Provide safeprogramming training for WaSH committees, district administrations, women groups other key stakeholders including traditional leaders    .\n# Protection awareness raising including community discussions on protection impact to address stigma and promotion of the call centre hotline   (already operational) to increase access to covid19 services for affected communities    .\n# Government capacity building/strengthen social safety net system in Somaliland : we will build the capacity of the government to be able to lead and coordinate Somaliland safety net program. Somalia launched safety net project called bahnano at Mogadishu but this has not been cascaded to Somaliland and Puntland. The government staff responsible for this are unable to run safety net due to their limited capacity. The project will target technical staff from the government and create enabling environment in the form of institutional capacity building including training of key staff, support implementation of beneficiaries selection and running coordination mechanisms smoothly.  Oxfam Somalia is implementing social safety net activity under GFFO top up. Under this activity the project aims improving supports to HHs in urban areas particularly COVID19 affected poorest or most vulnerable to prevent them to fall to poverty and destitution trap, manage COVID19 economic and social shocks and advance their lives <(>&<)> livelihoods. The government capacity in Somaliland on social safety net is to grow and as part of appeal fund, Oxfam will contribute to strengthening/establishing social protection system that leads COVID19 response project. Oxfam will partner with Somaliland Ministry of Employment, Social and Family as socialprotection responsible government body. Somaliland government capacity is yet to grow and this project will address this gap while also coordinating with other implementing agencies to strengthen their capacity to be able to lead social assistance and provide at scale in the future to its society as a right. The project creates an opportunity for governments to become the standard responders to large scale crises.",

The partners areaiming to harness the innovations of young people in Somaliland and beyond particularly social entrepreneurs, developers, changemakers, and health practitioners keen on bringing game-changing solutions to most vital social challenges focusing on in the areas of agriculture, technology, SDGs, health, food, education, and energy. The partners believe that tackling these complex issues will require diverse skill sets, backgrounds, effort and innovation. Harhub will be prioritizing innovations which may already be proven but will reach new heights of interest within the industry given the right support from Harhub, or innovations which are new ideas and concepts, but might need some tuning to fit the requirements of potential customers.\nThrough a competitive process, Harhub will reachout to 10k youth through social media promotions to apply the program for three weeks. Harhub is expected to receive quite big and competitive projects. Whilst applicants are ongoing, Harhub will create mentors\u2019 criteria and hire 3 mentors to lead selection and the Bootcamp. All the submitted projects will be evaluated by the mentors based on the solutions\u2019 unique value proposition, social impact, visibility, technical viability, and the individuals\u2019/teams\u2019 ability and capability to scale the solution.\n\nIn total, the mentors will then select twenty most advanced and innovative projects to attendthe two full days Bootcamp to be held at Harhub. The Bootcamp will be a high-energy workshop focused on rapid ideation, refinement, and prototyping of solutions. It is a space to generate, iterate on, and test ideas for social impact, foster a culture ofinnovation through experimentation, collaboration, and expand a community of social impact innovators. In the final event, twenty finalists will pitch their solutions for a chance to win grant funding, incubation, and mentorship scheme. The top three projects will be awarded a grant fund to their projects at Harhub with all support of providing free incubation and mentorship to develop, validate, execute and scale their solutions",

The unemployment rate for youth aged 15 to 30 is 67% - one of the highest rates in the world. Among young women, it is even estimated at 74%. Youth in Somaliland are not just the future ofthe country, they are also the majority.\nWith 67% of the youth being out of work, the high unemployment rate forthe youth remains abig challenge in Somaliland, and this rate is even higher for young women. The unemployment rate for young women in the country is estimated to be 74%. Due to the insecurity over the last two decade and stagnant economic growth, jobs have not been created at a rate that is able to match the growth of the youth population.\nWomen often face stiff competition during business pitching/competitions and often shy away to compete with their fellow men or observe stigmatization. This conceptwill bridge this gap by specifically earmarking this Women in Tech competition for young women tech savvies to compete among each other.\nTo achieve a long lasting and sustainable economic and social transformation in the country, we must empower young women, create opportunities for prosperity and provide them with the necessary tools and resources.\nHence Innovate Ventures (IV) in partnership and collaboration with Oxfam aim to support, accelerate and grow the Somali women startup scene and accelerate the growth of women startups in technology to help them create employment opportunities, and improve the investment climate in the country",

        "description": "6.3 million people are currently in need of humanitarian assistance across Somalia and Somaliland, with 2.6 million internally displaced and an estimated 1 million displaced in nearby countries. Whilst the deepening climate crisis exacerbates needs, Somalia and Somaliland are becoming increasingly stable, as persistent war gives way to erratic conflict and increasing capacity of government. Despite this, international actors face the obstacles of persistent issues of restricted access and highly challenging security circumstances. Local actors by contrast are able to transcend these issues and to guide interventions with nuanced local knowledge. This represents an opportunity to lead and deliver humanitarian aid locally. Somalia is one of the countries where a Joint Response to a protracted crisis under the DRA (SOMJR) is being implemented. With the changing context towards greater local leadership, the SOMJR already focuses on widening the space for local responders in humanitarian emergencies and decision-making fora. However, the Joint Response is fully led by INGOs, which inevitably creates unequal power dynamics that can negatively impact on the meaningful localization sought by local partners in Somalia. The protracted crisis situation, the long-standing presence of the DRA in Somalia, as well as the emergence of strong local humanitarian actors present the reality in which this PoC process can be carried out, and where an innovative pilot Joint Response focusing on meaningful localization would beworth exploring.\nThe Nexus Platform is an innovative response to the need for joined-up, localized responses at the triple nexus of humanitarian, development and peace programming: intervening to deliver coordinated outputs in all 3 spheres, which is essential in the Somali context, where climate shocks and conflict perpetually undermine humanitarian and development outcomes and deepen humanitarian crises. Although specifically tackled in the Somali context here \u2013 climate shocks and conflict are global causes of ongoing humanitarian crises, making the Nexus Platform\u2019s approach pertinent to challenges at the triple nexus in parallel circumstances. Comprised of nine local NGOs (footprint 30m USD), Oxfam andSave the Children International and entirely locally led, the platform is operational across every region of Somalia and Somaliland. The platform is built upon principles of South-to-South learning and civil society strengthening, whereby expertise is openly exchanged between member organizations to build a consortium that is more than the sum of its parts. Humanitarian response is central tothe platform\u2019s nascent phase. The platform envisions both multisectoral humanitarian response and the development of an Anticipatory Response Mechanism \u2013 utilisingthe platform\u2019s breadth of local access to trigger pre-emptive early action. The platform urgently needs \u2013 and is invested in developing \u2013 a model for its humanitarian programme areas through a PoC process which will allow the platform to rethink conventional humanitarian approaches that are particularly open to question in contexts such as Somalia. The process used to develop this model will be additionally adapted for the development of the platform\u2019s ways of working in the development and peace spheres:whilst humanitarian actions are the platform\u2019s immediate priority in its current scope of work, programs exemplifying locally-led decision making are planned in community development, government and civil society strengthening, women\u2019s empowerment and other areas across the triple nexus and these will require their own guiding PoC processes.",

        "description": "6.3 million people are currently in need of humanitarian assistance across Somalia and Somaliland, with 2.6 million internally displaced and an estimated 1 million displaced in nearby countries. Whilst the deepening climate crisis exacerbates needs, Somalia and Somaliland are becoming increasingly stable, as persistent war gives way to erratic conflict and increasing capacity of government. Despite this, international actors face the obstacles of persistent issues of restricted access and highly challenging security circumstances. Local actors by contrast are able to transcend these issues and to guide interventions with nuanced local knowledge. This represents an opportunity to lead and deliver humanitarian aid locally. Somalia is one of the countries where a Joint Response to a protracted crisis under the DRA (SOMJR) is being implemented. With the changing context towards greater local leadership, the SOMJR already focuses on widening the space for local responders in humanitarian emergencies and decision-making fora. However, the Joint Response is fully led by INGOs, which inevitably creates unequal power dynamics that can negatively impact on the meaningful localization sought by local partners in Somalia. The protracted crisis situation, the long-standing presence of the DRA in Somalia, as well as the emergence of strong local humanitarian actors present the reality in which this PoC process can be carried out, and where an innovative pilot Joint Response focusing on meaningful localization would beworth exploring.\nThe Nexus Platform is an innovative response to the need for joined-up, localized responses at the triple nexus of humanitarian, development and peace programming: intervening to deliver coordinated outputs in all 3 spheres, which is essential in the Somali context, where climate shocks and conflict perpetually undermine humanitarian and development outcomes and deepen humanitarian crises. Although specifically tackled in the Somali context here \u2013 climate shocks and conflict are global causes of ongoing humanitarian crises, making the Nexus Platform\u2019s approach pertinent to challenges at the triple nexus in parallel circumstances. Comprised of nine local NGOs (footprint 30m USD), Oxfam andSave the Children International and entirely locally led, the platform is operational across every region of Somalia and Somaliland. The platform is built upon principles of South-to-South learning and civil society strengthening, whereby expertise is openly exchanged between member organizations to build a consortium that is more than the sum of its parts. Humanitarian response is central tothe platform\u2019s nascent phase. The platform envisions both multisectoral humanitarian response and the development of an Anticipatory Response Mechanism \u2013 utilisingthe platform\u2019s breadth of local access to trigger pre-emptive early action. The platform urgently needs \u2013 and is invested in developing \u2013 a model for its humanitarian programme areas through a PoC process which will allow the platform to rethink conventional humanitarian approaches that are particularly open to question in contexts such as Somalia. The process used to develop this model will be additionally adapted for the development of the platform\u2019s ways of working in the development and peace spheres:whilst humanitarian actions are the platform\u2019s immediate priority in its current scope of work, programs exemplifying locally-led decision making are planned in community development, government and civil society strengthening, women\u2019s empowerment and other areas across the triple nexus and these will require their own guiding PoC processes.",

Oxfam's programming since March 2017 has successfully diversified the source of livelihoods in traditional pastoralist communities in Somaliland with plansto replicate this expereicnce in Puntland. This intervention will help vulnerable households to have some disposable income which they can use to purchase or meet their household food needs.Most vulnerable community members that will be most in need of the emergency assistance through this action will be identified through participatory mapping exercises conducted at village level through specific exercises including well-being rankings, vulnerability mapping, food consumption score, household purchasing power, among others.

        "description": "2020 was one of the hardest years for Somalia in decades. Flooding, COVID-19 and recurring locust invasions heavily impacted on theeconomy and livelihoods of people. The government implemented measures to contain COVID-19, including the closure of schools, reduction of movement and other economic activities. The coastal areas of Puntland and Somaliland were also hit by cyclone Gati in November 2020, resulting in a sharp increase in humanitarian needs which many organizations - including Oxfam Somalia - responded to. While the performance of the 2020 Gu rain was near normal, the Deyr rain of 2020 has been categorized a complete failure due to the La Nina conditions. These developments triggered severe water shortages in many regions and districts in Somalia. Since October 2020, regional administrations, communities and other humanitarian agencies have been sending alerts about looming drought conditions in many parts of Somalia.Oxfam\u2019s feedback hotline continues to receive a high number of calls from people requesting immediate water interventions. These callers are mainly from the Sool, Sanaag and Togdheer regions. UNOCHA assessment findings indicate that over 50% of the communities in the assessed locations reported displacement of people due to water shortages, 85% raised major concerns on watershortages, and 14 out of 40 villages reported an increase in diarrheal cases. The price of water has already more than doubled. According to Oxfam\u2019s own market assessment, one barrel of water is currently being sold at an average of USD 4.5 per barrel, with some villages reporting over USD 7 per barrel. This is forcing the most vulnerable households to travel long distances to fetch water and/or opt for poor water quality and risk their lives. The most affected communities include IDPs and low-income host communities. Women and girls are at risk of protection-related risks as they travel in search of water.\nRegarding COVID-19, over 4,784 cases with over 130 fatalities were registered by the WHO in Somalia since the start of the pandemic, with many cases left undetected due to asymptomatic infections, low testing capacity and the stigmatisation of COVID-19 cases among the population. The second wave of the pandemic seems to have also hit the country as the number of cases started to increase in the last few months. The government of Somaliahas eased most of the restrictions in August 2020 and most of the public services have resumed. This increases the risk of vulnerability to COVID-19 and the shortages of water in many areas further restrict the communities' ability to frequently wash their hands with soap. This might create a favourable environment for COVID-19 to spread.\nThe Ministry of Water Development in Somaliland shareda request with all humanitarian agencies, indicating that over 196,848 people are in need of urgent water interventions and that many others also require quick rehabilitations of their water sources. Over 88% of the people in need are from the Sool, Sanaag, and Togdheer regions of Eastern Somaliland. In October 2020, Oxfam using the ECHO crisis modifier budget reached the most vulnerable 1,800 HH (10,800 people) in Sool, Sanaag, and Togdheer for 30 days with WASH interventions. Since then, we have continued to advocate for urgent interventions by sharing summary reports with the Somalia WASH cluster and presentations of the situation with cluster members. Utilising other existing resources, we are also working with the Ministry of Water Resources to rehabilitate boreholes that were identified as strategic wells by the government.",

        "description": "The first component is aimed at capacity building. At least 40 beneficiaries (at least 30% female) including fishermen and women, fishmongers will undergo a maximum of six months theoretical and practical training. Youth fishermen and women will be trained on safety at sea, fishing gear mending and repairs, safe fishing methods and fish preservation, cooperatives establishment and fish quality assurance. Fishmongers, who will mostly be women, will be trained in various topics including fish handling and preservation, fishprocessing, personal hygiene, value addition (processing, grading, and packaging) and small business management. Entrepreneurship will be an integral part of the courses in order to leverage the entrepreneurship capacity\nThe second component is aimed at supporting the establishment/ strengthening of fishery organizations. The target beneficiaries will be organized in Self Help Groups (SHGs). The SHG is a rights-based approach which views poverty as the denial of rights and poverty alleviation as a process of reclaiming one\u2019s rights. Given the multi-dimensional nature of poverty, the SHG Approach puts equal emphasis on the goals of economic, social andpolitical empowerment . Therefore, the established/strengthened SHGs will have the potential to empower small-scale fishers againstsome of the environmental and socioeconomic shocks such as fish catch shortfalls and revenues, sickness and death in their families, natural disasters and hunger. The 30 young fishermen will be organized intoat least 5 SHGs and will be trained/ oriented on the operations of the SHGs\nThe third component will support the distribution of fishing kits/gear to the SHGs including women fishmongers.Midway through the training, the project beneficiaries will be provided with fishing gears in their SGHs. Such gear may include boats and other necessary tools. On the other hand, women fishmongers, will have business start-up kits including refrigerators and basic fish processing tools. The fishing kits/ gear will be owned and managed jointly in the SHGs.\nThe fourth component will focus on learning and knowledge management through value chain research. In order to ensure systematic market mapping in the fishing sector, understand actors, market share, capacity gaps, and other relevant value chain information, the project will undertake a robust research on fish value chain. The research will aim to bring out suitable models to link small holders to input and output markets and improve the benefits that fishermen and women and other resource-poor value chain actors derive from the chain. Knowledge generated from the research will be disseminated to different relevant stakeholders in the sector. It will also act as a building block for future scaling efforts of the project. As Oxfam and the partner have both long-term livelihood strategies, the research finding would beused for future programing.",

Accountability is \u201cthe process of using power responsibly, taking account of, and being held accountable by different stakeholders, and primarily those who are affected by the exercise of such power\u201d . It is the right to be heard, and the duty to respond.\n\nHowever, anecdotal information indicates that where CBFCMs initiatives and experiences exist in Oxfam, many are still disjointed, some are uncoordinated, and largely undocumented. In many places, they are non-existent, or if they are, not all of them are fully functional. The design of Oxfam\u2019s CBFCMs by Affiliates, Country Offices and in part Partners has not always ensured community involvement, in most cases resulting in not fit for purpose mechanisms. Also different affiliates still approach the issue of CBFCMs differently with different emphasis, approaches, tools and resources, therefore lacking a standardised coordinated approach.\n\nAlthough Oxfam prides itself for encouraging communities we work with to speak out and report PSEA and child protection concerns and incidents concerning them,recent reports in some countries like DRC, Ethiopia, and Uganda not only attests to the limited awareness at community level on SEAand child protection risks and reporting mechanisms, but has also led to an increase in attention to ensure that SEA and child abuse and exploitation by humanitarian and development organisations like Oxfam are addressed through investment in preventive approaches but also responding to reports of abuse and exploitation when these incidents are reported.\nOxfam has two responsibilities for accountability in the programmes it manages, holding a responsibility for mutual accountability with its partners (as do the partners) and also holding a shared or joint accountability (with its partners) to the communities affected by its programmes. There is lack of knowledge how the\nIn addition to some of the above challenges, COVID-19 has added additional challenges to how effective current CBFCMs are, placing additional barriers to reporting that are currently not fully understood or risks mitigated.\nOBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT:\n1. Map out existing CBCM\u2019s initiatives in select field/project locations, and document best practices and lessons learnt in implementing CBFCMs across the Oxfam confederation\n2.

The objectives of the proposed DPF are to facilitate full normalization of relations with the World Bank Group (WBG) and support Somalia's economic recovery through policy reforms that strengthen fiscal management and promote inclusive private sector-led growth. Up to SDR 271.2 (up to US dollar 375 million equivalent) of the proposed grant will be disbursed to the bridge-loan creditor assisting with arrears clearance (\u2018Portion A of the Financing\u2019); and SDR 32.6 million (US dollar 45 million equivalent) will be disbursed to the Federal Government of Somalia (FGS) as budget support to meet cash flow needs after Somalia has cleared its arrears to IDA (\u2018Portion B of the Financing\u2019). The DPF complements a rapidly expanding engagement to build human capital and strengthen resilience to climate change and other shocks. In FY2020, the World Bank is currently delivering technical assistance to develop livestock insurance, a major Urbanization Review, and upstream analysis on health and education that are expected to inform new financing. The DPF also addresses the above challenges by enabling full reengagement with the WBG. The DPF will facilitate Somalia's clearance of arrears to IDA, which is a requirement to qualify for international debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. Full reengagement with the international community through the HIPC process is expected to enable Somalia to access the financial and technical support the country needs for sustained poverty reduction and inclusive economic growth.

It builds on the positive experience of Canadian philanthropic engagement via UNICEF Canada\u2019s UNdaunted Initiative already established in Sub-Saharan Africa. This project works to improve learning outcomes for girls, including those with disabilities, by increasing their equitable access to safe, quality, inclusive, education within an education system that recognizes their needs, and provides innovative and quality gender-responsive formal and non-formal education. The project aims to target 156 schools in up to 20 districts of the Federal Government of Somalia and Federal Member States: the Puntland State of Somalia and Somaliland. Project activities include: (1) facilitating public awareness around disability and gender issues through activities such as community outreach, and providing training to education stakeholders on developing policies on the protection of girls from gender-based violence in schools and to foster safe learning spaces; and (2) providing technical assistance to Ministries of Education and educational officials to strengthen capacity on data collection, as well as to integrate adolescent girls with disabilities into their education systems. This project is expected to reach 22,500 girls, including 7,500 girls with disabilities in the formal and informal education systems. The project is also expected to benefit 1,248 teachers; 1,092 members of community education committees; and 70 government officials.",

The structure of the DRA enables participating NGOs to respond to major international crises in a timely and effective manner. The rising number of humanitarian disasters around the world has placed an increased burden on international aid organisations. The global increase in the number of armed conflicts \u2013 and the deepening complexity of these conflicts \u2013 is also adding to the severe strain on the existing humanitarian system. The Dutch Relief Alliance (DRA) was established to meet these challenges. Improved cooperation and coordination between NGOs enables them to better respond to major international crises in a timely and effective manner. The DRA members collaborate in humanitarian interventions \u2013 delivering greater impact than members operating independently. The DRA members are: CARE Nederland; Cordaid; Dorcas; ICCO en Kerk in Actie; Oxfam Novib; Plan International Nederland; Red een Kind; Save the Children; SOS Kinderdorpen; Stichting Vluchteling; Tearfund NL; Terre des Hommes; War Child; World Vision; and ZOA.

For four years, Clingendael Academy would extend its negotiation training offer to the humanitarian sector to increase its capacity to provide humanitarian assistance to those in need. After a few months of preparation, the first training was delivered in July 2017 in The Hague with especially created negotiation simulations and interactive exercises. In 2018, Clingendael Academy saw this programme really take off within the sector with ever increasing numbers of applications for our training courses, at times with three applications per available spot. It appears we are meeting a real demand in the humanitarian sector.",

        "description": "The project will support the Somali Health Authorities in 10 targeted districts (Abdiazir, Bondhere, Hamarweyne, Hodan, Shangani, Shibis, Waberi, Wadajir, Wardhigley, Yaqshid) in Banadir to: 1. Increase access to, utilisation and quality of health and nutrition services at community, primary and secondary health levels, especially for women, children and vulnerable populations and; 2. Strengthen the health system under the stewardship of the Somali Health Authorities (SHAs). The project\u2019s approach focuses on strengthening the SHAs\u2019 capacity at the regional, district and community levels to deliver the EPHS (core services 1-6). Lessons from Joint Health Nutrition Programme (JHNP) and other programmes, identified a critical management gap at the district level in Banadir. A core focus of the project\u2019s methodology is therefore to support the Regional health Officer (RHO) in Banadir to establish and develop a District Health Management Team (DHMT) in each of the 10-targeted districts. Having an operational management body at district level, within the SHA structure, will be an essential component of ensuring that the health facilities and community/female health workers (CHWs/FHWs), in their respective districts, are able to receive the technical, management and logistical support required for them to successfully deliver integrated, quality, health and nutrition services that the population can access. This is a structure and model that has been demonstrated to be successful in other health systems (e.g. in Kenya). The consortium will work closely with the RHO throughout the project to establish, develop and support the DHMTs.",

In these places, the virus is likely to be even more deadly than it has been here. \n\nImagine having to leave everything behind to keep your family safe, only to face a deadly new threat: Covid-19. This is the reality for people living in tents and makeshift shelters without running water or soap in places like Syria, Yemen and Somalia.\n\nBut, as we have seen in the UK, simple measures can make a huge difference. If we act now to protect millions of vulnerable refugees and displaced people, many lives can be saved. \n\nWe need your help to: \n\nprovide families with clean water, soap and information on keeping themselves safe \nprovide frontline medical and aid workers with equipment and supplies to care for the vulnerable and sick\nensure families get enough food to prevent malnutrition, particularly amongst children\nPeople who have already suffered so much need your help now more than ever to face this new threat. Please give whatever you can at this challenging time for us all.",

        "description": "This project is part of the ILO ILO Flagship Programme on Jobs for Peace and Resilience and is based on the Employment and Decent Work for Peace and Resilience Recommendation, 2017, (No. 205). It builds on ongoing work to promote employment, decent work and income opportunities in Somalia. The project strategy draws on the findings of the review of the DWCP of Somalia (2014-2016), which among other issues, has pointed to the need for tailored capacity development interventions to enable workers and employers organizations to deliver services to their members and effectively engage in social dialogue. The project interventions will focus on: (i) addressing the youth employment challenges; (ii) creating a strong connection between humanitarian and development support; (iii) building on employment-intensive investment strategies; and (iv) integrating direct employment creation and skills and enterprise development for increased employability. The project is expected to provide opportunities for the ILO to leverage resources, expertise and synergies at the country level, notably through cooperation and collaboration within the UN system as well as with development partners. This project contributes to the country\u2019s efforts to advance towards the attainment of SDG targets 1.5 (Build the resilience of the poor and those in vulnerable situations and reduce their exposure and vulnerability to climate-related extreme events and other economic, social and environmental shocks and disasters) and 8.3 (Promote development-oriented policies that support productive activities, decent job creation, entrepreneurship, creativity and innovation, and encourage the formalization and growth of micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises, including through access to financial services).",

Greater attention will be given to the inclusion of the marginalized and women. The programme aims to achieve three outcomes: Outcome 1: Policy, legal and regulatory frameworks on local governance finalized: - Policy and legislative frameworks for functional, fiscal and administrative decentralization clarify the role of local governments and their relationship to federal/central and state governments, with a view to attaining improved service delivery and stability. Outcome 2: Local governments\u2019 have the capacity to deliver equitable and sustainable services, promote economic development and peace:- Building on the successes and lessons from previous phases, JPLG will consolidate, harmonize and systematize, its capacity enhancement approaches \u2013 bearing in mind the different contexts under which it operates. In Somaliland, the focus will be to empower Local Government Institute (LGIs) as drivers of capacity building initiatives. In Puntland, and the new states the programme will work with the Ministries of Interior and other partner ministries to streamline capacity development initiatives while, putting in place mechanisms to operationalise the recently approved National Local Government Capacity Development Policy (see Annex 3). It will focus on supporting capacity development beyond JPLG districts and apply capacity development lessons from Puntland to boost the new FMSs and BRA. In the new federal member states, the program will build local governments\u2019 capacity to deliver equitable services, deepen stabilization and contribute to economic recovery. Outcome 3: Local governments demonstrate improved engagement of citizens, with an emphasis on women and marginalized groups:-The aim of JPLG III is to promote citizen engagement, gender equity and social inclusion, through efforts to strengthen key local governance policies, structures and processes. Barriers to women\u2019s advancement in public administration, denial of opportunities for citizens, particularly traditionally marginalized individuals and groups, to take part in, and benefit from, local decision-making, all serve to undermine the principles of equal opportunity and social justice that are the bedrock of inclusive development and democratic governance \u2013 while retaining a driver of conflict. The funds received under DFID are to support activities under Outcome 2, in addition these activities are under \u2018Outcome 3: Sustainable local government investment vehicles are identified, designed and operated\u2019, in the Local Investment for Transformation in Somalia (LIFT-Somali) agreement with UNCDF.",

        "description": "This Joint FGS-UN Programme aims to capitalise on recent security, governance and reconciliation achievements by expanding employment opportunities for young men and women, mainly in newly recovered areas. The programme recognizes the centrality of youth in fostering stability in the country and outlines specific interventions that can be taken within the next 24 months to begin to generate decent work opportunities for young people that will serve as positive alternatives to participation in violence and conflict. This will also contribute to the revitalization of the local economy. The programme will tackle youth at risk, unemployed and underemployed youth. The employment generating interventions from this programme also aim to augment the credibility of the FGS and build trust and confidence in local governance and security sector institutions while providing immediate peace dividends to vulnerable sub-sections of the population. As encouraged in the New Deal Compact, this joint youth employment programme is a frontline intervention of the FGS to achieve rapid results under Peace and State-building Goal (PSG) 4 (Economic Foundations), which identifies youth employment through job creation and skills development as one of the most important priority projects over the next two years. Creating growth and job opportunities are a crucial part of development assistance and Somalia is in urgent need of decent employment and income generation opportunities. The private sector is responsible for 90 percent of jobs in developing countries, making it an essential partner in the fight against poverty and the engine of innovation, investment and growth. There are many obstacles which stand in the way of private sector development, the mains ones being: unfavourable investment climate, infrastructure shortages, lack of access to finance, lack of skills development opportunities and weak linkages between supply and distribution chains. Tackling such constraints will create job opportunities for young Somali men and women. Therefore, the FGS, with the support of UN agencies, will undertake the following interventions in newly recovered areas and other government priority areas over the next 24 months. The programme will initially be tailored for the first 24 months as per the Compact deadline (see also Table 1): \u2022 1: Improved long-term potential for growth, productivity and employment of at least three value chains in the agriculture, fisheries and livestock sector. \u2022 2: Equip 10,000 youth with basic literacy, numeracy and life-skills and sector-specific vocational and business training to enhance their employability to access sustainable job opportunities in sectors with high growth and employment potential. \u2022 3: Create 30,000 short-term jobs created through cash-for-work projects to rehabilitate productive infrastructure in target locations, mainly in newly recovered areas.",

Greater attention will be given to the inclusion of the marginalized and women. The programme aims to achieve three outcomes: i) Outcome 1: Policy, legal and regulatory frameworks on local governance finalized: - Policy and legislative frameworks for functional, fiscal and administrative decentralization clarify the role of local governments and their relationship to federal/central and state governments, with a view to attaining improved service delivery and stability. ii) Outcome 2: Local governments\u2019 have the capacity to deliver equitable and sustainable services, promote economic development and peace:- Building on the successes and lessons from previous phases, JPLG will consolidate, harmonize and systematize, its capacity enhancement approaches \u2013 bearing in mind the different contexts under which it operates. In Somaliland, the focus will be to empower Local Government Institute (LGIs) as drivers of capacity building initiatives. In Puntland, and the new states the programme will work with the Ministries of Interior and other partner ministries to streamline capacity development initiatives while, putting in place mechanisms to operationalise the recently approved National Local Government Capacity Development Policy (see Annex 3). It will focus on supporting capacity development beyond JPLG districts and apply capacity development lessons from Puntland to boost the new FMSs and BRA. In the new federal member states, the program will build local governments\u2019 capacity to deliver equitable services, deepen stabilization and contribute to economic recovery. iii) Outcome 3: Local governments demonstrate improved engagement of citizens, with an emphasis on women and marginalized groups:-The aim of JPLG III is to promote citizen engagement, gender equity and social inclusion, through efforts to strengthen key local governance policies, structures and processes. Barriers to women\u2019s advancement in public administration, denial of opportunities for citizens, particularly traditionally marginalized individuals and groups, to take part in, and benefit from, local decision-making, all serve to undermine the principles of equal opportunity and social justice that are the bedrock of inclusive development and democratic governance \u2013 while retaining a driver of conflict.",

Dar\u00fcber hinaus tr\u00e4gt das Projekt zur Stabilisierung der fragilen Sicherheitslage in den Projektst\u00e4dten S\u00fcdzentral-Somalias bei und f\u00f6rdert so die Friedenskonsolidierung vor Ort, wie im Marshallplan mit Afrika, \"Afrika und Europa - Neue Partnerschaft f\u00fcr Entwicklung, Frieden und Zukunft\" gefordert. Der Ansatz zielt auf die Verbesserung sozialer und produktiver Infrastruktur und ist multisektoral, sodass Ma\u00dfnahmen in den Bereichen Transport, Wasser- und Sanit\u00e4rversorgung, M\u00fcllentsorgung, Bildung und Gesundheit m\u00f6glich sind. In Mogadischu wurden bereits Ma\u00dfnahmen im Bereich kommunale Infrastruktur identifiziert, f\u00fcr die St\u00e4dte Kismayo und Baidoa wurden bereits Vorstudien erstellt. Die einzelnen Ma\u00dfnahmen werden im Rahmen der Umsetzung festgelegt. Zur Planung und Umsetzung der o.g. Ma\u00dfnahmen werden die Strukturen des Multi Partner Fund der Weltbank (MPF) genutzt, der zur Umsetzung der FZ-Mittel ein gesondertes Finanzierungsfenster f\u00fcr st\u00e4dtische Infrastruktur einrichtet. Zur F\u00f6rderung des von der Gebergemeinschaft angestrebten \"State-Building\" werden somalische Regierungsstrukturen soweit wie m\u00f6glich in die Planung, Gestaltung und Umsetzung der Ma\u00dfnahmen eingebunden. Auch die direkte Anbindung an den nationalen Entwicklungsplan ist damit sichergestellt. Zur Finanzierung des Vorhabens stellt das BMZ insgesamt 23,24 Mio. EUR aus FZ-Altmitteln und einer neuen bilateralen Zusage bereit. Angesichts der gro\u00dfen Bedarfe in den drei Projektst\u00e4dten erfolgte dar\u00fcber hinaus eine Vorratspr\u00fcfung in H\u00f6he von 50 Mio. EUR.",

Dar\u00fcber hinaus tr\u00e4gt das Projekt zur Stabilisierung der fragilen Sicherheitslage in den Projektst\u00e4dten S\u00fcdzentral-Somalias bei und f\u00f6rdert so die Friedenskonsolidierung vor Ort, wie im Marshallplan mit Afrika, \"Afrika und Europa - Neue Partnerschaft f\u00fcr Entwicklung, Frieden und Zukunft\" gefordert. Der Ansatz zielt auf die Verbesserung sozialer und produktiver Infrastruktur und ist multisektoral, sodass Ma\u00dfnahmen in den Bereichen Transport, Wasser- und Sanit\u00e4rversorgung, M\u00fcllentsorgung, Bildung und Gesundheit m\u00f6glich sind. In Mogadischu wurden bereits Ma\u00dfnahmen im Bereich kommunale Infrastruktur identifiziert, f\u00fcr die St\u00e4dte Kismayo und Baidoa wurden Vorstudien erstellt.

Das Projekt zielt darauf ab, einen Beitrag zur Verbesserung der Lebensbedingungen der Bev\u00f6lkerung und dort angesiedelter Binnenfl\u00fcchtlinge sowie zur\u00fcckkehrender Fl\u00fcchtlinge zu leisten. Dar\u00fcber hinaus tr\u00e4gt das Projekt zur Stabilisierung der fragilen Sicherheitslage in den Projektst\u00e4dten bei und f\u00f6rdert so die Friedenskonsolidierung vor Ort. Das stimmt mit den Forderungen im Marshallplan mit Afrika \"Afrika und Europa - Neue Partnerschaft f\u00fcr Entwicklung, Frieden und Zukunft\" \u00fcberein. Der Ansatz zielt auf die Verbesserung sozialer und produktiver Infrastruktur und ist multisektoral, sodass Ma\u00dfnahmen in den Bereichen Transport, Wasser- und Sanit\u00e4rversorgung, M\u00fcllentsorgung, Bildung und Gesundheit m\u00f6glich sind. In Mogadischu wurden bereits Ma\u00dfnahmen im Bereich kommunale Infrastruktur identifiziert, f\u00fcr die St\u00e4dte Kismayo, Baidoa und Garowe wurden Vorstudien erstellt.

Hierf\u00fcr werden schrittweise in drei St\u00e4dten S\u00fcdzentral-Somalias integrierte Gewerbeschulzentren aus- und neugebaut und ausgestattet. Das Konzept der integrierten Gewerbeschule zeichnet sich zum einen durch einen an klaren Qualit\u00e4ts- und Pr\u00fcfungskriterien ausgerichteten, praxisorientierten Unterricht aus. Zum anderen bieten die Gewerbeschulen verschiedene Dienstleistungen im Bereich Weiterbildung und Unternehmensf\u00f6rderung f\u00fcr die lokale Wirtschaft an. Das Vorhaben unterst\u00fctzt die Gewerbeschulzentren dabei, ein breites Dienstleistungsangebot zu entwickeln, dadurch Einnahmen zu generieren und sich mit einem nachhaltigen Finanzierungsmechanismus langfristig selbst unterhalten zu k\u00f6nnen. Durch die Verankerung in die lokalen Gemeinden und den Einbezug benachteiligter und vulnerabler Jugendliche verschiedener Clans sowie von Binnenvertriebenen sollen die Gewerbeschulen als friedensstiftende Begegnungsorte und Entwicklungspole der lokalen Wirtschaft wirken.",

        "description": "EGEP-T aims to increase girls\u2019 learning in numeracy, literacy and life skills, whilst supporting them through key transition points in education and beyond to improved life opportunities. The project will also be developing community and institutional capacity to ensure support to girls\u2019 education is sustained in the longer term. EGEP saw significant progress regarding community members\u2019 expectations of girls about girls\u2019 education between baseline and midline. General support for girls\u2019 education increased by 27% across community members surveyed and the percentage of caregivers stating gender to be an important factor determining whether a child should go to school declined from 54% to 9%. Respondents frequently noted that community members themselves are engaging in awareness-raising activities. School enrolment increased by 20% and attendance increased by 5%, which suggests this positive shift in attitudes has led to positive results in school. Learning levels increased, however, they did not reach the intended targets. 37% of girls who enter secondary school have dropped out by Form 4. A contributing factor behind these less positive trends appears to be that the aspirations of caregivers and communities for girls\u2019 education can be at odds with the considerable expectations placed on girls in terms of traditionally assigned gender roles. EGEP conducted 70 FGDs with girls, asking them what the most critical challenges were that lead to girls\u2019 decreased participation in school in later grades: after economic factors, the most common response was early marriage, and the third most common response was household chores. Additionally, girls are often expected to prioritise care of siblings or contribution to household income over schooling and homework. These expectations intensify as the girl reaches adolescence. Furthermore, within the school, girls are not necessarily expected to achieve at the same level as boys, to hold leadership positions, and to complete the full education cycle. The table below provides examples of severely marginalised groups of girls the project will target, the current expectations for these groups and how they differ from what the project intends to achieve:",

        "title": "Desert Locusts Joint Response - Lead",
        "description": "The current locust crisis in the Horn of Africa is the worst outbreak of locusts in over 25 years in Ethiopia and Somalia and the worst observed in over 70 years in Kenya. The situation rapidly deteriorated in January 2020 as weather conditions have been unusually conducive to the spread of the pest. These conditions will allow breeding until June 2020 and could lead to 500 times more locusts, with the formation of large numbers of swarms. Desert locusts are expected to continue to breed and spread during the coming months. Given their life cycle, the March-April start of the long rains, coinciding with a regeneration of rangeland and the start of planting activities, will enable a new wave of breeding and further spread of the pest. Desert locusts have already reached northern Uganda, and looking forward, the infestation could: 1) spread further into the Rift Valley (especially in Ethiopia), as well as to South Sudan, 2) affect the 2020 main and secondary staple cropping seasons, and 3) continue to affect rangeland across the region. The desert locust is considered the most destructive migratory pest in the world as it is highly mobile and feeds on large quantities of any kind of green vegetation, including crops, pasture and fodder. A typical swarm can be made up of 150 million locusts per square kilometre and is carried on the wind, up to 150 km in one day. Even a very small, 1 km2 locust swarm (approx. 40 million desert locusts) can eat the same amount of food in one day as about 35 000 people. This can be especially devastating in areas where food security is poor and, where every gram of food produced counts towards minimizing gaps in a family\u2019s food consumption. Currently, the region faces widespread food insecurity. In Ethiopia, an estimated 8.5 million people are severely food insecure, Phase 3 and above, according to IPC between February and June 2020. In Somalia, from February to September 2020, the population in IPC Phases 3 (Crisis) and 4 (Emergency) is expected to rise by 40 percent, from 1.1 million to 1.6 million people. Drivers of this food insecurity include climate shocks, conflict, and macroeconomic crises. Ethiopia has been responding to the current swarm invasions since July 2019. To date, hopper bands have covered more than 429 km\u00b2 of the country. Two generations of breeding have caused large numbers of swarms to form and move to Kenya and Somalia. In January 2020, the swarms were also seen moving towards the Rift Valley in Ethiopia and Kenya\u2019s breadbasket. This would pose a serious threat, especially as Ethiopia already has an estimated 8.5 million people facing severe food insecurity. In Somalia, where 6.7 million people are now regarded as acutely food insecure (IPC Phase 2 and above), swarms bred in the north of the country and have moved mainly to central and southern regions. The pest is affecting pasture and threatening staple food crops in rural areas. Insecurity and a lack of national capacity have hampered control operations. The Somalia Food Security Cluster showed their findings in a presentation; the number of people affected was shown as over 2.5 million (21% of Somalia\u2019s population) and especially pastoralist, agro-pastoralist, riverine and IDPs are affected. COVID-19 In light of the global pandemic of COVID-19, on 25 March 2020, the United Nations launched a USD 2 billion Global Humanitarian Response Plan (GHRP). On 3 February, WHO also launched a Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan (SPRP). The following responses, corresponding with a locust crisis response, must be accelerated or scaled up to achieve Strategic Priorities 2 and 3 of the Covid-19 HRP: - Food and nutrition assistance as well as rural livelihood support to food-insecure and malnourished people vulnerable to the infection particularly in countries experiencing food crises. - Scale-up of social assistance systems, and cash transfer programmes with complementary livelihood assistance (including adaptations for remote digital trade/marketing), particularly for rural crop and livestock workers and producers, small/medium businesses, refugees, IDPs, migrants and host populations, and other food-insecure population groups. The Somalia section of the Covid-19 HRP mentions under the most affected and at-risk population groups that the pandemic could also heavily impact vulnerable communities living in areas dealing with food insecurity and desert locusts, while Ethiopia section mentions that COVID-19 response will undermine efforts to combat desert locust infestations. While people\u2019s lives are threatened by the COVID-19 outbreak, the upcoming two agricultural production seasons are threatened by desert locust infestations. The number of COVID-19 cases reported in both Somalia (237) and Ethiopia (111) as of 20-04-2020 is still relatively low (also due to underreporting). Yet, the countries follow government restrictions and the response is designed with integrated COVID-10 measures.",

Ministry of Health has increase\nd capacity to steer manage and coordinate the health sector The Somali diaspora experts particularly the Finnish Somali diaspora experts are the actors in the capacity building efforts. They train the local health professionals and participate in developin\ng strategies plans standards and curricula for health sector. Particular attention is given to women's and child health. In the long term the project is expected to contribute to better health outcomes for Somaliland population and especially the health ou\ntcomes for women and children.The first Finnish funded MIDA project was initiated already in 2008. The project has been evaluated twice and the findings suggest that the project has significantly strengthened public health institutions? ability to provide \nquality services in Somaliland. The findings and recommendations of evaluations have been duly notified in the planning of the Finnsom IV phase: For example the project now focuses on the more remote regions in Somaliland where service provision is poorer \nthan in the capital Hargeisa. Similarly following the recommendations the length of the assignments of diaspora experts has been increased for Phase IV.To support the implementation of the project the National Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) also im\nplements tailored trainings for the Ministry of Health.The duration of the Phase IV is four years from March 2017 until February 2021.

        "description": "Support to the UN Population Fund's (UNFPA) country programme continues Finland's strong contribution for the development of Somalia's reproductive maternal and child health care services. UNFPA has been among the three UN agencies that have been involved \nin the UN Joint Nutrition and Health Programme in Somalia (JHNP) which focused on the development of maternal and child health services. Finland supported the implementation of the programme for 15.5MEUR between 2014-2016. JHNP has provided services for an\n area covering half of Somalia's population. It has reached good results having significantly contributed to the reduction of maternal and infant mortality. Through JHNP UNFPA has supported the provision of maternal sexual and reproductive health services \nas well as contributed to improving their quality. UNFPA has supported the running of 135 maternal clinics; the training of midwifes in 15 midwiferies throughout Somalia; the provision of training on reproductive health for over 600 health care professiona\nls; as well as the provision of technical assistance to the ministries of health to support their capacity building including their work on health sector strategic development. As JHNP is coming to an end in early-2017 UNFPA continues the work to develop t\nhe reproductive maternal and child health care in Somalia according to its mandate.UNFPA country strategy for Somalia for 2011-2016 has been extended for one year to cover also 2017. Its overall objective is to improve the wellbeing of Somali people. The c\nountry strategy aims to achieve this through reducing maternal mortality and through supporting the realization of reproductive rights and services. In addition the strategy supports gender equality and combats gender-based violence as well as strengthens \nthe Somali statistical systems and promotes evidence-based planning and policy design.Three particular priority areas have been identified for 2017:1.Increased provision of comprehensive sexual and reproductive health services (around 50% of the annual bud\nget for 2017)2.Promotion of gender equality and prevention of gender-based violence (around 25% of the 2017 budget)3.Strengthened national capacity on use of quality disaggregated data for evidence-based planning and policy design on population and develop\nment issues (around 25% of the 2017 budget)Finland supports the implementation of the UNFPA Somalia country strategy for 2011-2017 for 2 million euros.",
