Dar\u00fcber hinaus tr\u00e4gt das Projekt zur Stabilisierung der fragilen Sicherheitslage in den Projektst\u00e4dten S\u00fcdzentral-Somalias bei und f\u00f6rdert so die Friedenskonsolidierung vor Ort, wie im Marshallplan mit Afrika, \"Afrika und Europa - Neue Partnerschaft f\u00fcr Entwicklung, Frieden und Zukunft\" gefordert. Der Ansatz zielt auf die Verbesserung sozialer und produktiver Infrastruktur und ist multisektoral, sodass Ma\u00dfnahmen in den Bereichen Transport, Wasser- und Sanit\u00e4rversorgung, M\u00fcllentsorgung, Bildung und Gesundheit m\u00f6glich sind. In Mogadischu wurden bereits Ma\u00dfnahmen im Bereich kommunale Infrastruktur identifiziert, f\u00fcr die St\u00e4dte Kismayo und Baidoa wurden bereits Vorstudien erstellt. Die einzelnen Ma\u00dfnahmen werden im Rahmen der Umsetzung festgelegt. \u0152 \u0152Zur Planung und Umsetzung der o.g. Ma\u00dfnahmen werden die Strukturen des Multi Partner Fund der Weltbank (MPF) genutzt, der zur Umsetzung der FZ-Mittel ein gesondertes Finanzierungsfenster f\u00fcr st\u00e4dtische Infrastruktur einrichtet. Zur F\u00f6rderung des von der Gebergemeinschaft angestrebten \"State-Building\" werden somalische Regierungsstrukturen soweit wie m\u00f6glich in die Planung, Gestaltung und Umsetzung der Ma\u00dfnahmen eingebunden. Auch die direkte Anbindung an den nationalen Entwicklungsplan ist damit sichergestellt. Zur Finanzierung des Vorhabens stellt das BMZ insgesamt 23,24 Mio. EUR aus FZ-Altmitteln und einer neuen bilateralen Zusage bereit. Angesichts der gro\u00dfen Bedarfe in den drei Projektst\u00e4dten erfolgte dar\u00fcber hinaus eine Vorratspr\u00fcfung in H\u00f6he von 50 Mio. EUR. \u0152",

        "description": "In summary, this project proposes to contribute to three core aspects of Camp Coordination and Camp Management in Daynille District and spontaneous settlements in the Afgooye District, including leading essential coordination functions, developing and maintaining camp infrastructures that have been devastated by recent flooding.establishing/Rehabilitating/Enhancing drainage systems in IDP sites through incentivized workdays carried out by site-level site maintenance committees, and promoting humanitarian accountability through the operation of feedback and complaint mechanisms. Moreover, this project will also focus on building the capacities of the IDP leadership and local actors to gradually take over the camp management responsibilities. \n\nNoFYL will conduct the basic care and maintenance of the camps in Daynille District and spontaneous settlements in the Afgooye District the upcoming care and maintenance phase presents a different range of challenges, requiring strong humanitarian leadership and very close engagement with the population to promote community ownership and empowerment, as well as the gradual transfer of responsibility for the care of the site infrastructure. NoFYL will continue to work regularly with IDP camp leadership and committees to strengthen collaboration and their participation in decision-making processes, while also striving to improve diversity in representation and gender balance in the governance structure. As NoFYL anticipates, new arrivals will continue to seek shelter within the sites and spontaneous settlements throughout the project period, NoFYL's Camp Management team will support this population with reception and conduct site verification monthly. The quarterly Site Verification exercise in Afgoye district will be conducted to provide multi-sector information on access and availability to basic services in the floods affected sites to ascertain gaps in service provision and monitor services being provided, the verification will be conducted by NoFYL's multi-functional mobile teams, this will help to produce detailed information on the population of each site, its perimeter, access and services available in sites. NoFYL will use this data and contribute to its dissemination in order to inform humanitarian response at each level.\n\nThis overarching objective will be achieved by enhancing the overall protective environment for flood-affected population, increasing access to basic services linked to different sectors, reducing the risk, and availing specialized support assistance to beneficiaries to help them address other interconnected protection concerns. The action is also conceptualized to consolidate the ongoing humanitarian response to the flood situation in the targeted locations. Through this grant, NoFYL will reach 1,550 HHs in 8 umbrella Camps (considering minimum 180 HHs per settlement) with a total target beneficiary of 12,400 in Daynille and  Afgooye districts with necessary services through a coordination mechanism set in place with relevant stakeholders and other partners.\n\nThis project will also be linked to this ongoing protection/HLP activities through monitoring, documentation, and reporting of threats to evictions by assessing potential eviction sites, preventing and responding to eviction. Capacity development targeting settlement managers, CMCs, and local authorities on Housing, Land, and proper protection monitoring through ensuring collection of information based on the methodology of the Somalia Protection Monitoring System (SPMS).",

        "description": "This project is designed to respond to education, WASH and protection needs of children affected by floods in seven rural villages of Jowhar District of Middle Shabelle in Hirshabelle State of Somali for six months. The villages have either been affected by floods due to River Shabelle breaking its banks and flooding the settlements and farmlands in the riverine areas or flash floods sweeping the villages as a result of above-normal heavy Hagaa rains experienced in the region. The Guu rains expected between October and December are likely to result further deterioration of the situation.\nEducation facilities in the targeted villages are closed since most of them were affected either flood from river bank breakage that saw them completely inundated or marooned by water. \nThe villages are generally food insecure as the population is faced with acute unemployment, the prohibitive cost of living, and lack of skill sets by majority of the dwellers to eke meaningful living. The situation is further exacerbated by cyclic droughts and flash floods that are making agro-pastoralism lifestyle untenable and thus many are dropping out to join the ever-increasing population of vulnerable persons in the riverine regions. The worst affected are children and women who often bear the brunt of neglect and abandonment during these hard times. This often makes them susceptible to abuses and exploitations such as Gender-Based Violence, sexual exploitation, early marriages, child labor and recruitment to armed groups. \nThe project intends to use school attendance as an important preventive factor for child protection, particularly the girl-child. The project will employ such interventions as, training of teachers on basic child protection skills, provision of child-friendly environment through improvement and repair of damaged temporary/ permanent classrooms. Aid Vision will establish and strengthen the capacity of CtC clubs to provide peer interaction forums to learners, provision of teaching and learning materials-including recreational materials, capacity building of CBCPCs to raise awareness on risks of child abuse and enhance children\u2019s access and retention at schools. The CBCPCs will contribute to service mapping, identification of referral pathways and disseminate the information about available child protection service for children in the community. CP Focal Points, trained on PSS/PFA, will facilitate structured gender sensitive recreational and PSS activities at the schools for both boys and girls throughout the project live and conduct child safety walk and audit/ /risk mapping exercises with the guidance of project CP supervisor.\nTo address urgent WASH needs at the schools and ensure continuous learning for 2000 learners, Aid Vision will supply water to 7 schools for 6 months which will be delivered by trucks. Each school will have water storage tank with taps placed at strategic location for easy access. 23 twin gender-sensitive latrines will be constructed at schools that lack sanitation facilities. All latrines will have sufficient water, hand washing facilities and lockable doors for meaningful access. Girls and boys will attend CP awareness sessions to be organized for all schools. This is aimed at ensuring they have preventive skills on violence against children. Girls latrines usage will be monitored and corrective actions taken to address safety concerns. Regular hygiene promotion campaigns focusing on handwashing and safe water handling will be conducted at schools for 14 days to prevent the risk of AWD/Cholera outbreak. Hygiene promotion sessions will follow where schools\u2019 health clubs will disseminate messages on good hygiene practices at schools. To ensure schools have sustained access to water 2 shallow wells damaged by floods will be rehabilitated and protected with hand-pumps. 9 manually operated hand-free hand washing stations will be installed and soap for hand washing provided to reduce risk/transmission of COVID-19.",

        "description": "The floods have been triggered by heavy, above-average rainfall locally and in upstream areas in the Ethiopian highlands and have affected Gedo, Hiraan, Middle Juba, and Middle and Lower Shabelle regions. The situation has been exacerbated by weak river embankments and open riverbanks. The worst affected districts are Balcad, Jowhar, and Mahaday in Middle Shabelle (Hirshabelle) Afgooye and Wanlaweyn districts in Lower Shabelle (South West State), and Belet Weyne (Hiraan) where over 85 percent of the displacement has occurred. Somalia\u2019s marginalized communities and internally displaced persons are expected to most severely be affected by the impact of the floods. An estimated 132,000 hectares (ha) of agricultural land and 294 villages along the Shabelle River have been affected by the Hagaa floods. New displacements and further disruption to livelihoods are expected as foreseen moderate to heavy rainfall in the Ethiopian highlands are likely to raise Shabelle River levels over the coming weeks, likely resulting in additional flooding in the middle and lower reaches of the Shabelle. Of particular concern is Jowhar town and its environs in Middle Shabelle, where the river level is near the full crest, and other riverine towns in the Lower Shabelle region. Thus, in this project ZAMZAM foundation aims to extend immediate support to the flood-affected most vulnerable men, women, and children including disabilities and marginalized communities and IDPs in Jowhar district through immediate support to food access, protect their livelihoods, support local food production, and prevent the adoption of crisis strategies. In order to reach the objective of the project ZAMZAM will carry the following activities: \n(1) Increase access to food and improve nutrition through Unconditional cash transfer to 555 HHS representing 3,330 most vulnerable groups of the community in Jowhar district including widows, women head HH, families with disabilities, or with severe prolonged illness, and isolated families without external support. The supporting period will be 3 months and the rate is 60% of Minimum Expenditure Basket (MEB) which corresponding to 60 USD. (2) Restore the livelihood to 2,310 flood-affected vulnerable farmers through the distribution of agricultural input, to start their farming activities, protect their livelihoods, support local food production, and prevent adaption of crisis strategies. The selection criteria of the project beneficiaries will be: (1) Women headed households, (2) households with disabilities, (3) households with malnourished children and women (4) poor households, and (5) households with farming lands. \nDuring the selection of the beneficiaries, ZAMZAM will consult with the line ministry, district local authority, community leaders, women groups, disabled people, marginalized communities, and religious groups, in order to make the selection fair, transparency, and accountability.\n\n(3) To keep the sustainability of the project and increase the production of the beneficiaries, ZAMZAM will train selected 200 lead farmers to share equally men and women from the target farmers on the best technologies and methodologies to increase their livelihoods production.\n\nThe project will seek to increase food supply, reduce hunger, counter rising food prices, and improve responses to food emergency crisis by extending the area of land cultivated under good agricultural practices. The project will use a similar approach to improve the use of adapted varieties, early planting, correct sowing, use of soil enhancing plant species, observing rotations, precision fertilizer placement and timely application, correct spacing, timely weeding, and post-harvest storage.",

The appeal to the United Nations for support is a matter of urgency as those two referral facilities are facing a dire need to keep power stability while treating and testing patients with COVID-19.  \nThe RC/HC has decided to use the Humanitarian response funds to finance the support and requested UNDP to handle the procurement process to provide the generators. From the quotations already sought by the OPM, the estimate cost for the two generators is USD 160,000 including delivery and installation. UNDP is currently launching its own competitive sourcing to come up with financial proposals for contracting the supplier with the best value for money. Before a contract is signed, a budget should be available in Atlas, hence this submission in GMS to secure funding.",

With an increase in Gender Based Violence following flooding in Beledweyne and Afgooye, there is an urgent need to improve access to quality multi-sectorial support for survivors and enhance community based protection mechanisms.  \nTo address this, RI will run two Women and Girl Safe Spaces (WGSS) in Beletwyne and Afgooye. One of the WGSS will be static located within a health facility in Afgooye and the other WGSS in Beletwyne will be mobile in nature and linked to one of RI supported static WGSSs at the health facilities for referrals and further support of the survivors. RI is running 4 static WGSS in Beletwyne with support of UNFPA. The Mobile WGSS will be able to reach out to higher grounds where communities have relocated yet cannot access the static WGSS facilities. Approximately 400 women and girls will be reached with advocacy, PSS, referral, case management and material support. \nBoth static and Mobile WGSS will be staffed with female and male GBV staff, CHWs and medical staff who will provide GBV response and services to targeted communities. While the medical team will be responding to offering GBV related medical treatment, the GBV staff will run both men and women sessions separately while the CHWs will be conducting door to door GBV awareness and provide avenues for safe reporting of GBV and referrals to Mobile unit team for medical, PSS and case management. WGSS staff will provide survivor centred case management through PFA, medical treatment and facilitating referrals for other services. In addition, the WGGS will serve as a place where women and men meet weekly to get information on GBV prevention and response and establish social support groups where they share and learn from each other. The WGSS are designed with the specific needs of women and girls to have the space they need to be able to voice their concerns and needs in regards to issues that affect them personally.\nRI will update and strengthen already existing linkages with other GBV service providers for referral purposes and to ensure survivors and those at risk are able to access quality multi-sectoral services as needed with RI providing support and follow-up on all cases. RI will work with community health workers to ensure they have the necessary skills and understanding to identify GBV cases and make appropriate referrals. \nTo enhance community-based protection mechanisms, RI will work with all members of communities, including both IDPs and Host Community members women, men, boys and girls, and community/ religious leaders. Activities will include awareness campaigns, advocacy platforms, community protection audits and trainings. \nThe project is expected to reach 5,989 direct beneficiaries (3,929 female and 2,060 male) and 93, 545 indirect beneficiaries. Approximately 50 (20 girls and women) will be engaged in GBV safety audit and action planning in their communities. 4,000 (1,220girls,1,260 women, 800 boys and 720 men) will be reached through door to door community outreach and over 25,000 reached through GBV radio advocacy and awareness creation. 450 dignity kits and 250 emergency support kits and 2000 sanitary kits will be distributed. Approximately 150 GBV survivors will be supported to access survivor centered multi-sectorial response and material support. A total of 25 religious leaders will be engaged in GBV advocacy and 14 (9 female) clinical and non-clinical staff will be trained on GBV response including Clinical Management of Rape (CMR), Psychological First Aid (PFA), and Psychosocial Support (PSS) and GBV Case management.

        "description": "In response to the growing humanitarian crisis in southern Somalia SOS CVS is proposing the following interventions to expand lifesaving Child protection and GBV services to vulnerable populations in two districts in middle Shabelle region. SOS CVS will support the most deprived children, women and girls in IDP camps, those affected by emergencies, crisis and displacements, those at risk of family separation as well as victims of gender based violence whose vulnerability increases due to breakdown in community structures. The project will be implemented in two districts in Middle Shabelle region (Balcad and Jowhar)\n\nThe main objective of the proposed integrated protection project is to improve the protection of the targeted children, girls and women from abuse, violence and exploitation in the target area. The  integrated protection emergency response  is designed to improve the protection of the target children, girls and women from abuse, violence and exploitation through provision of psychosocial and mental health support  and provide rapid identification, tracing and family reunification services for those at risk of family separations. In addition to this, unaccompanied and separated children in the intervention targeted IDPs will be reunified with their caregivers/guardians and those children who do not have caregivers/guardians will be supported through community based (clan/kafala) foster care placements.  Through existing Community Protection Committees (CPC), provide a platform to establish community\u00ac based child protection mechanisms (CBCPMs) to facilitate the identification of and response to child protection concerns, the development of community\u00ac based mitigation plans, prevention messaging (e.g. on forced recruitment) and child protection surveillance mechanisms. \n\nThe project propose to create CFS at community level that will provide psychosocial and recreational support through structured and age appropriate group and individual activities including recreation, skill building and basic learning activities. The proposed CFS will also provide children with a protective and conducive environment to play socialize and learn to express themselves.  In addition, the project will provide psychosocial and parenting activities to both IDPS and host communities and their caregivers. The project will provide community-based PSS and resilience activities aimed towards coping and strengthening protective environment for children and their parents. Child right groups will be established at community level and provide psychosocial support (PSS) workshops (MHPSS) services to key targeted beneficiaries in view of increasing child resilience in IDP and surrounding communities. This will be conducted in the CFS centers at the community level.\nThe project will also carry out community based mapping to identify safety risk for children and provide  insight into what issues exist and better understanding of how issues connect to each other and plan for mitigation to support the identified risk.\n\nThe project is also designed to increase women and adolescent girls access to life saving prevention and response measures through providing GBV services, case management, PSS counselling to traumatized GBV survivors to reduce risk of GBV at target districts.  To provide timely, effective and efficient GBV responses, the proposed project will train health workers and caseworkers in CM and CMR of rape survivors.  Community based GBV volunteers will be trained to conduct GBV services awareness campaign. This will offer an opportunity to provide much needed response services in the target areas that are without GBV and protection services.  \n\nFinally the intervention will also provide child protection awareness creation on COVID 19 and adopt WHO and CP AoR approved IEC risk communication and print it in local language as well general awareness child protection prevention messages.",

Risk education activities implemented as part of the project will seek to reduce the risk of death and injury EO by raising awareness and promoting safe behavior. Most at-risk communities will be identified and reached through life-saving messages tailored to specific groups. \nTargeted communities will be better equipped to identify the threat and adopt safe behaviors, such as sharing information among their communities and reporting any suspicious items to the Somali authorities. To promote the sustainability of the project, MAG will build the capacity of local partners through the training of community liaison officers (CLOs) from JUMAN and the continuous monitoring, evaluation, and feedback of the activities implemented. This will enable them to continue delivering risk education messages, once the project is completed. Also, it will strengthen their position as key points to collect reports from the community and consolidate information related to EO contamination for future use of HMA stakeholders and Somali authorities. The effectiveness and scope of the intervention will be greatly improved by local partners with field teams who are familiar with the context.  \nOn measuring the impact, MAG expects to find based on previous data that over 70% of EORE recipients demonstrated improved knowledge and practices with regards to their recognition of and behavior around EO, while 70% of EORE recipients indicate they feel safer following the intervention. This methodology of conveying   EORE, the project will allow similar baseline figures to be collected with regards to the effectiveness of awareness risk education and used for future planning.\n\nAccording to the protection cluster (Abor Indicators for HNO Sept 2020), about 2,228,463    EO people are categorized as persons in need (PIN) for the explosive hazards awareness sensitization in the Banadir region where the project is targeting leveling them as severity phase 3 of which 497,000 are among the those displaced by the floods while 1,731,463    EO is the host communities in various districts within Banadir region.

These areas are currently concerned by displacement and voluntary return movements and, with the intensification of the military operations around AS control areas, it is expected that a high number of newly displaced people and/or newly accessible people will be imminently in need of critical assistance. Further to this, recent wave of flooding affected a significant segment of the population in Jubaland and several parts of South Central, including Kismayo and Belet Weyne in Hirshabelle. In addition to physical destruction, communities lost HLP assets and are now being confronted with the daunting prospect of either recovering abandoned assets or engaging in recovery initiatives that would help to develop or re-acquire such assets. As part of the response framework, the project will provide populations falling into such categories with specialised support assistance to help them overcome legal obstacles central to the protection, exercise and enjoyment of their HLP rights. The project also seeks to develop adequate HLP capacity within these communities, to co-exist peacefully and be protected from unlawful evictions, and to help stakeholders better understand the extent of the damage to HLP assets as well as alternatives to addressing the problem. The project will also conduct HLP assessments by mapping damaged HLP assets and the implication of the damage to protection outcomes and the enjoyment of rights. NoFYL will also undertake Post flood eviction response, prevention initiatives, negotiations and monitoring and reporting. HLP Legal aid service provision will also be supported through the project.\n\n\nThe overarching objective is to monitor and report on protection risks, human rights violations and gaps in available service, are identified and addressed through protection monitoring and analysis.\n\nTo achieve the expected outcome NoFYL will through its skilled and highly trained monitors will collect accurate data/information on displacement and protection incident necessary to inform responsive and strategically targeted humanitarian response in the target locations. The expected outcome will also be achieved through enhancing access to emergency protection assistance for populations victimised by serious protection incidents through referral to specialised support services, include psycho social and clinical support by specialized case workers and nurses. \n\nThe project will have the following outcomes.\n\n1.\tIncreased availability of information necessary to inform responsive and strategically targeted humanitarian response in Kismayo amp Balcad.\n2.\tEnhanced access to emergency protection assistance for populations victimized by serious protection incidents including provision of emergency protection assistance and referrals for specialized care.\n3.\tJoint multi-sectoral assessments facilitated including eviction monitoring, post-return monitoring, service mapping, protection incident monitoring, ongoing rapid assessments on flood damage assessments, and alert reporting.\n4. \u2018   Communities supported to recover from the impact of flood.\n5.     Increased availability of legal services for post flood HLP issues.\n\nNoFYL is currently an SPMS partner leading data collections in Kismayo, Afgoye and Mogadishu (Deynille amp Kaxda districts).",

In order to reduce congestion and overcrowding, NRC will engage local community leaders to select beneficiaries in the affected areas and after selection use an electronic mobile data collection tool called 'Kobo Tool box' to register all targeted beneficiaries, 20% of the selected beneficiaries will be poor host community members in line with 'Do No Harm' principals. Similarly, 15% of the targeted person will be those with disabilities (PWDs) will also be selected from the targeted areas. Beneficiaries will be provided with cash ($100 per each HH in single installment) for NFIs while $145 (80% or $116 as the first installment and remaining 20% or $29 as the second installment) per HH will be provided for Emergency Shelter Kits. In order to enable a holistic response and deliver greater impact, each household will benefit from both the NFIs and ESKs provision. NRC will acquire the services of local telecom company Hormuud Telecom for the cash transfers and with this adhere to strict beneficiary verification protocols which in this case will also include beneficiary verification by the service provider through their mobile Identities before disbursement of the cash. This beneficiary list will include the names of the selected beneficiaries, mobile number, token numbers, location of residence and gender. It is only upon verification of the beneficiary details as submitted by NRC that the service provider shall disburse. Beneficiaries whose personal details are not approved will go through a second round of verification process. \n\n80% of the targeted beneficiaries will be IDPS while 20% will be host community members . A predetermined beneficiary selection criteria that considers the needs of Extremely Vulnerable Individuals (EVIs) including female and single-headed HHs, orphans, chronically ill, aged and child-headed households will be applied . These criteria will be refined further and agreed upon with community leaders at inception to ensure that only those that are in real need receive aid. Gender will be mainstreamed at each and every stage of the action with specific attention given to the multiple and diversified needs of women, men, boys and girls. The project is designed to ensure that all potential beneficiaries in the location of action have equal opportunity to access resources and training through the complete application of a rights and needs only based approach. Monitoring and evaluation of all components will be informed by refined and easy to use M and E tools that disaggregate data according to age, gender and diversity. This action shall deliver urgent humanitarian flood response assistance in the form of cash for NFIs and ESKs to 1,350 HHs (8,100 individuals) in district Belet Weyne.\n\nTo ensure that the assistance provided is used for intended purposes, NRC s will coordinate all components of this action with the community to ensure thorough sensitization and beneficiary participation  for individuals and the community at large .A Post Distribution Monitoring (PDM) exercise will be conducted after 6 weeks of NFIs and ESKs distribution to determine use of cash and while also assess the impact of the response, generate and document lessons learned for dissemination to multiple stakeholders.",

        "description": "According to OCHA flash floods report Since July, up to 166,379 people have been affected by flash floods in Afgooye, Marka and Wanlaweyn districts in Lower Shabelle region when riverbanks broke along River Shabelle. The floods have displaced in Wanlaweyn alone more than 82,000 people, inundated homes, wells and schools and destroyed large swathes of farmland and crops The heavy deyr rains ave caused massive population displacement, damaged housing, property, infrastructure and farm lands in riverine areas in southern Somalia. WASH Cluster has reported critical gaps in Balcad, Marka and Wanlaweyn where no WASH assistance has been received despite high risk levels for AWD.\nThe main aim of this project is to provide lifesaving WASH services to most vulnerable and underserved communities living in floods affected areas in Wanlaweyn district of Lower Shabelle Region. A total of 17,000 flood affected men, women and children including the disabilities, marginalized communities and IDPs will benefit safe drinking water and will have access equally throughout the project period.\n\nSOYDA in collaboration with the local authority, partnership with main water vendors in rural villages in Wanlaweyn district, will provide emergency water voucher to the 6,400 (1408 men, 1,536 women, 1,728 boys and 1,728 girls) targeted beneficiaries including people with disabilities and marginalized communities in the targeted IDP camps, which they can redeem for water at the specified water vendors (water trucks). The action also includes to hire water truck of a capacity of 6,000 liters of safe water to the targeted locations. Each voucher can be used to redeem specified quantity of safe water of 7.5 liters per person per day for a period of 30 days. The project will build the capacity of 1q WASH Committees (composing 4 men and 3 women per Committee) shared equally men and women on operation and maintenance of developed water infrastructures shall be throughout the project implementation period, to ensure the sustainability of the developed water facilities after the project is faced out. SOYDA will make sure that men, women, girls and boys including people with disabilities and marginalized community have equal access to the rehabilitated/constructed WASH services. SOYDA will upgrade/rehabilitate two boreholes equipped with hybrid to improve its water quality and reduce its running cost, in order to receive the community their water needs at an affordable cost. SOYDA will replace the engine powered boreholes in to hybrid system and construct 8 water kiosks nearer to the IDP settlements supplied water through piping network to avoid the risk of rape against women and girls in Wanlaweyn district. The project will provide reliable and sustainable access to environmental sanitation through construction of 100 IDP latrines in Wanlaweyn district. The latrines will be gender separated and flood proof with lockable doors and hand washing basins. construction of latrines will be implemented through market-based programming. \n\nSOYDA will distribute 80 sanitation sets to 10 IDP camps, in order to improve the environmental sanitation of the targeted locations. The aim of the sanitation sets distribution is to carry out clean-up campaigns, in order to reduce the spread of AWD/cholera diseases and to improve the environmental sanitation of the target locations. SOYDA will conduct comprehensive hygiene promotion campaigns focusing hand washing with soap practices to 17,000 men, women, boys and girls through visiting house to house, health facilities, and nutrition centers. SOYDA will also train 30 Community Hygiene Promoters (CHPs) shared equally men and women, selected from the target communities and IDPs, so that in their turn they can educate the entire population to change their behaviors. 1600 HP kits will be distributed to the most vulnerable and underserved communities in the target locations",

        "description": "Humanitarian situation in Middle Shabelle has deteriorated due ongoing flooding in last two consecutive rainy seasons and now communities in low lying areas along the Juba and Shabelle river valleys in south central Somalia are grappling with a new wave of flooding during Hagaa season due to the intensive rains started within the Ethiopian highlands. The worst affected districts by floods are Balcad, Jowhar and Mahaday in Middle Shabelle (Hirshabelle) Afgooye and Wanlaweyn distr icts in Lower Shabelle (South West State) and Belet Weyne (Hiraan) where over 85 per cent of the displacement has occurred. The flooding situation in Balcad district has resulted in massive displacement affecting particularly children, mothers and the elderly who are now facing serious hunger, health and protection risks in an area already receiving little to no humanitarian assistance due to insecurity. The floods have destroyed food reserves and threatened food markets. Significant gaps have been reported in flood-affected areas regarding to food, emergency shelter, non-food items, and safe drinking water, sanitation facilities and poor hygiene. Mothers, children, and the elderly as well as disabled people are extra affected due to the fact that displacement puts them at risk of exploitation since they lack their normal income routines and familiar environment. People are at a high risk of hunger and illness such as water-borne diseases which has already been reported in some of the flood affected areas. The impact of the ongoing flooding in Hirshabelle compounded by economic and social impacts of COVID-19 and forecast of below-average Gu rainfall from October to December 2020 may result in further deterioration of humanitarian outcomes for affected communities through 2021. The proposed project aims to save the lives of affected communities in Balcad district and enhance resilience building by provide safe, equitable and sustainable access to safe and sufficient water for drinking, cooking, personal, and domestic (15L/p/day) through by drilling and construction of 1 borehole and rehabilitation of 3 boreholes and 5 shallow wells, construction of 100 flood proof latrines that consider the disable people, distribution of hygiene and sanitation kits to improve sanitation conditions and establishment and train water management committees to the operation and maintenance of the facilities. The project will target the most vulnerable households (men, women boys and girls) affected  differently by the ongoing floods but give special attention to female-headed households, the  elderly and people living with disability. Market-based programming (MBP) will be considered in all the activities to strengthen and working with existing markets supply chains and service providers in project target areas to meet the needs of crisis-affected populations.GSA has extensive experience of working in the WASH sector within Balcad district and can mobilize rapidly due to strong links with communities and government.",

The floods have been triggered by heavy, above-average rainfall locally and in upstream areas in the Ethiopian highlands and have affected Gedo, Hiraan, Middle Juba, and Middle and Lower Shabelle regions. The floods have been triggered by heavy, above-average rainfall locally and in upstream areas in the Ethiopian highlands and have affected Gedo, Hiraan, Middle Juba, and Middle and Lower Shabelle regions. The floods temporarily displaced households to higher grounds in several prone areas including Belet Weyne. The recurrent floods have inundated the roads, WASH infrastructures, crops, houses and etc. A cholera outbreak fueled by limited access to safe drinking water, poor sanitation, and displacement has already been reported in some of the flood-affected districts, underscoring the need for urgent repair and rehabilitation to damaged WASH infrastructure and the provision of clean water. More cases of acute watery diarrhea (AWD) are being reported in children under five years old, who are particularly vulnerable to disease, especially if their immune systems are compromised by malnutrition. Thus, in this project, AADSOM will improve access to safe water, sanitation facilities and promote good hygiene practices to reduce the negative impacts of the flood in the Belet Weyne town and 9 villages in Belet Weyne district to 19,000 women, men, boys, and girls including people with disabilities, minorities and most vulnerable underserved communities. Key activities AADSOM would like to undertake within this project the following WASH services:\nWater:\n- Provision of safe water to 1,000 households representing 6,000 men, women and children affected population through water vendors (water trucking) by using Water Voucher (WV) \n- Rehabilitation/construction of 29 flood-damaged shallow wells with hand pumps.\n- Establishment and capacity building training to gender-balanced 29 WASH committees and 58 Well Operators shared equally by men and women, to ensure continuity of service, operation, and maintenance, coupled training on DDR and conflict resolution mechanisms as cross-cutting\n\nHygiene and Sanitation:\nLack of access to adequate and appropriate sanitation and hygiene poses a serious threat to public health. The practice of open defecation is a leading cause of fecal-oral transmission of diseases with children being the most vulnerable. A safe and appropriate latrine accompanied by handwashing with soap provides an effective barrier to the transmission of diseases. The provision of appropriate facilities for defecation is also an essential response for people\u2019s dignity, safety, health, and well-being. To improve safe access to sanitation it is necessary to meet standards of privacy and safety of women and girls against GBV using sanitation structures that are locally or culturally acceptable. never the less, the disabilities will be given a special design that is appropriate and acceptable for use. in this project, AADSOM will: \n\n- Conduct comprehensive hygiene promotion campaigns to reach 19,000 men, women, boys, and girls through visiting house to house, schools, health centers, and feeding centers \n-Train 10 community hygiene promoters (5 men and 5 women), who will carry out hygiene promotion activities during and after the project is faced out \n-Distribute of 1,000 HP kits to 1,000 households with vulnerable men, women, and children, and\n- Construct 263 gender-sensitive and flood-proof latrines for the most affected community including latrines for disabled people in ensuring the sustainability of the latrines during floods.",

        "description": "Merka communities face scarcity of safe and sufficient water due to abnormal dryness and floods coupled with the effect of pandemic since march 2020. At this critical moment, vulnerable communities rely on unsafe water for drinking and domestic use, leading to increased health risks and poor living standards. Floods further undermine the sanitation services available in Merka and its environs. During the most recent floods in August 2020, over 60 percent of latrines were non-functional due to the floods leading to high rates of open defecation and increased incidences of water-borne diseases. To reverse the negative impact of recent natural hazards and increase the resilience of Merka IDP and host communities, a sustainable WASH intervention capable of withstanding these shocks and improving living standards is vital. ARD will respond to this compounded risk by implementing living saving WASH services in six largely underserved and high-WASH risk IDP sites in Merka, including Ceel xaaji, Ceel Ahmed ,Shalaamboot,Horseed and Ceel Jaale IDP sites, and will serve 3,000 households (18,000 individuals). The below proposed WASH activities are fully aligned with allocation strategy for flood response and as well as WASH cluster response strategy detailed in HRP 2020\nWater \nThrough water voucher assistance for a period of 60 days, provide safe drinking water to 1,300 flood affected families who have no access to clean water, or their water points are unsafe for drinking and needs disinfection and rehabilitation\nConstruction/rehabilitation 20 unprotected shallow wells installed with hand pumps. ARD will ensure the all rehabilitated wells will have infrastructures that can resist future floods. \nTo ensure the sustainability of rehabilitated water infrastructures, 20 WASH committees and 40 well operators will be trained on operation and management of water facilities.\nSanitation\nConstruction of 140 gender separated and desludgable flood proof latrines with lockable doors and handwashing facilities benefitting a total of 4,200 flood/AWD/cholera affected people. Around 7% (i.e. 10) of flood proof latrines will be allocated and designed for people living with disabilities (PWDS).\nCarry out environmental sanitation services to all project target locations especially IDP camps to improve all preventive measures against the risks of AWD/cholera outbreaks in Merka district, 4,500 people will benefit the environmental sanitation services by conducting mass clean-Up campaigns to manage solid waste in IDPs and host populated settlements. ARD will procure and distribute 60 sanitation tools to support the cleanup campaigns. \nHygiene\nUsing MBP/CVA modality, distribute 2,000 hygiene kits to reach 12,000 people affected by the floods or at risk of AWD/cholera in Merka district. The hygiene kit will constitute the following items: 200 aqua tabs, 1 Jerry can (20l Capacity), 1 bucket (20l capacity) and 5 bars of soaps (each 800mg) and 1 box of female sanitary item.\nConduct comprehensive hygiene promotion activities focusing on behavior change including hand washing with soap practices at critical times through health hygiene education campaigns targeting 18,000 people.\nTrain 10 Community Hygiene Promoters (50% female and 50% male) to conduct hygiene promotion session in project target areas\nTo ensure the sustainability of this action, ARD will collaborate with the affected communities and other humanitarian actors to ensure the affected population are provided with sufficient clean water services through water trucking for a period of 60 days, ARD will ensure to use voucher system through selection of the most vulnerable populations in Merka. Moreover, ARD will construct flood-resistant and gender-sensitive latrines to ensure year-round use as well as the distribution of WASH kits through vouchers, establishment of WASH Management Committees and hygiene sensitization sessions.",

Two long decades of armed conflicts, clan clashes and drought have resulted in millions of Somalis becoming in dire need of basic life savings assistance. Forced to flee their homes to survive, today there remains a staggering 2.6 million internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Somalia. Based on total numbers, Somalia represents the fourth largest IDP crisis in the world. \n\nCurrently, an estimated 2.6 million people across Somalia remain internally displaced and highly impoverished. Deyr assessment results indicate that the 11 major Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) settlements are in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or Stressed (IPC Phase 2) in the presence of humanitarian assistance. In most urban areas, food security outcomes are Stressed (IPC Phase 2) or Minimal (IPC Phase 1). However, households in urban areas in Burao (Toghdeer) region are facing food consumption gaps and are classified as Crisis (IPC Phase 3), driven by high cost of living and limited income-earning opportunities. This notwithstanding, the sustained and large scale humanitarian coordination is preventing more severe outcomes in many regions across Somalia. \nIn this context ACTED will: Establish, reinforce and strengthen governance, management and coordination mechanisms at appropriate levels Increase site safety through site maintenance and improvement works and Capacity Build Camp Governance, CCCM stakeholders and local authorities working towards self-management.

The advocacy and campaigns will aim to ensure actors facilitate lawful eviction processes. Capacity development targeting settlement managers, local authorities on Housing, Land and proper protection monitoring through ensuring collection of information based on the methodology of the Somalia Protection Monitoring System (SPMS). WASH intervention will be complemented by PAH through the distribution of complete kits of hygiene, capacity building of water committees and community hygiene promotion through community outreach and awareness campaigns, addressing sustainable access to water, hygiene, and capacity building needs. ESNFI intervention will be complemented by HINNA by improving the IDPs living conditions through the distribution of emergency NFI kits and emergency shelter kits.\n\nAt the initial stages of project implementation, the partners will organize an inception meeting with different actors with the support of the relevant cluster Coordinators. Rapid service mapping of actors will also be conducted to understand who is doing what and where to inform intervention areas and avoid duplication. NoFYL field teams shall actively participate in coordination mechanisms in Kaxda and Deynille to ensure other actors are updated on NoFYL plans in targeted districts to avoid overlap. This project will fill existing gaps in ESNFI, CCCM, Protection, and WASH support and complement activities undertaken under other ongoing projects. NoFYL will carry out post-distribution monitoring utilizing a tailored PDM tool in all targeted locations within 1 month of each assistance intervention sampling 20-30% of beneficiaries in each location. \n \nNoFYL, PAH and HINNA will implement these activities in 15 IDP sites in Deynille and Kaxda, targeting the most underserved area home to most newly displaced drought IDPs in the same sites to enhance the delivery of protection services as a complement to the other activities. 4,064 households, approximately 24,384 people (3,283 male, 4,886 female, 6,505 boys and 9,710 girls) will benefit from this intervention, as well as the whole community working in these 41 IDP sites including local authorities, clusters, and other organizations. The multi-sectoral approach will be useful to create synergies enabling the concentration of services and expertise within the same location and the same population leading to achieving a greater impact.\n \nThe three partners (NoFYL, PAH and HINNA) will build on each other strengths and better complement each other to ensure community acceptance and success in implementation. The synergy between the 3 sectoral partners will ensure sound management of the program, greater impact, efficiency, and more cost-effective operations.

        "description": "In 2019, COVID-19 emerged, and the WHO has declared its outbreak as a global pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic is a global health crisis that has resulted in a great disruption to education worldwide. Education has been hit particularly hard by the COVID-19 pandemic with 1.53 billion learners out of school and 184 country-wide school closures, impacting 87.6% of the world\u2019s total enrolled learners. Drop-out rates across the globe are likely to rise as a result of this massive disruption to education access. Thus, the Somali Government took precautionary measures as stopping international flights, closing learning institutions, and banning large public gathers. As the Government continues to monitor the situation, CISP plans to mitigate and minimize the impact of school closure and interrupted student learning, particularly for the most vulnerable. As there is a lack of clarity on how the COVID-19 situation will evolve globally and locally in Somalia, CISP will forecast long-term contingency measures ensuring that the impact of COVID-19 on students will be addressed as schools remain closed. In Somalia, it has affected learning and forced the closure of learning institutions including schools and universities since March 18th, 2020. In responding to this outbreak, CISP adapts the Ministry of Education, Culture, and Higher Education (MoECHE) strategy on COVID-19 preparedness and response. \nThe proposed 9-month intervention will target 12 schools with an enrolment of 3462 learners with the provision of food, TLM, and Dignity kit while 19,890 adults and children of school-going age children will be targeted with radio PSA and health messages to provide mitigation measures on the impact of COVID-19 on top of other existing challenges such as conflict, drought and desert locust for learners both school holidays and when schools reopen. The project will improve access to critical WASH inputs, emergency food for students to meet their food and energy needs, payment of emergency teacher incentives to motivate teachers to stay in the schools, provision of teaching and learning materials (TLM). Specific WASH activities will include the distribution of handwashing soaps, liquid detergents, rehabilitation of latrines, provision of storage water tanks, water trucking for schools with no constant water supply, and improving hygiene practices among children through engagement with school hygiene promoters. Following the Federal guideline on social distancing CISP will work with the ministry of health and MoECHE to explore the possibility of having smaller groups of teacher and CEC\u2019s to train so as to maintain 1.5-meter distance in order to implement a lifesaving training of hygiene and Sanitation on preparedness, mitigation and response to COVID-19 pandemic and identification of COVID-19 symptoms to prevent the spread of COVID-19 among the school community. CISP proposes this project to improve access to quality education and making schools child-friendly for COVID-19, drought and conflict-affected communities, and host community children Galgaduud region of Galmudug State of Somalia. The project directly addresses the educational needs of both the displaced and host community children. This project will create a protective environment for children through the improvement of hygiene/sanitation in schools thereby making schools learner-friendly and also the provision of quality education through providing learning resources, general community sensitization through radio PSA will be aired through Galmudug radio station on the COVID-19 pandemic awareness and prevention.",

        "description": "Despite a favorable Deyr (October- December) rainy season, the lingering effects of the drought in 2018/2019, and flooding an estimated 1.3 million people in Somalia will be in Crisis (IPC Phase3) through mid-2020 without sustained humanitarian assistance. Currently, 4 million people are experiencing acute food insecurity, out of whom 2.9 million are Stressed (IPC Phase 2) and 1.1 million are facing Crisis or worse. Among the most vulnerable are 2.6 million internally displaced persons (IDPs) who remain highly impoverished. According to IOM, October 2019 report, Baidoa, the capital of Bay region, hosts one of the largest IDP populations in Somalia. According to figures compiled by the international community, as of September 2019, Baidoa had 359,994 internally displaced persons, consisting of 51,322 households on 435 sites.\n\nTherefore, looking into this precarious situation, the proposed project is designed to respond to the immediate lifesaving and life sustaining basic needs of poor and vulnerable displacement affected communities in Bay region. Project proposes three rounds of Multipurpose cash transfers to the most vulnerable displacement affected communities. Moreover, project will also provide cereal crops and vegetable seeds to displacement affected communities living in the off camp area. At the same time this we understand that as a result of locust infestation, beneficiaries pastoral and agro-pastoral communities are forced to migrate to other areas, therefore under this program NRC will be providing Fodder vouchers to the migrating communities. Support in the form of fodder vouchers will help communities to purchase fodder for their livestock during the time of migration. This cash injection will help benefiting households in accessing food and other unmet needs on immediate basis from the accessible markets. The monthly cash transfer amount will be as per the cash and market working group recommended transfer rate which will help beneficiaries to meet 80% of the full minimum expenditure basket. As a result of cash injection, affected households will have improved access to the diversified food and will positively contribute to the nutritional outcomes. \n\nProposed project is in line with the Food Security cluster strategic response objectives SO1: Improve households\u2019 immediate access to food through provision of conditional and unconditional cash assistance depending on the severity of food insecurity phases, vulnerability and seasonality of the livelihoods.\n\nAs soon as beneficiaries identification and  registration will be completed, NRC will be conducting a Baseline survey in order to have baseline values. After baseline, registered beneficiaries will be released monthly multipurpose cash transfer in line to the cash and market recommended transfer rates using electronic services of Harmuud. NRC team will be collecting post distribution monitoring (PDM) data two weeks after release of each round of cash transfer. As a standard practice, PDM captures some of the key information around timeliness of support, progress against critical indicators including \u2018Food consumption score (FCS) and Household dietary diversity score\u2019. PDM also monitors expenditure patterns of the provided support and determines measures for corrective actions if there are deviations from objective.",

        "description": "The overall objective of the proposed project is that the food security situation of 865 vulnerable households (5160 individuals) in mostly rural communities in Zeylac district of Somaliland is stabilized and communities are more resilient towards adverse conditions.\n\nTo achieve the overall objective, the project offers: a) unconditional and b) conditional cash transfers for improved access to food. The project directly targets an estimated 5160 individuals ( mostly rural communities) particularly women, children and the elderly and other vulnerable persons in Casha Cado, Togoshi, Lawya cado, Sheikh Awaare and Zeyla villages. The project duration is 8 months to allow families to recover from adverse weather conditions and the potential desert locusts\u2019 threat. \n\nSpecifically, 565 households (HH) will receive Unconditional Cash Transfers (UCT) while 300 households will receive Conditional Cash Transfers. The cash transfers empower people with choice to address their essential and individual food needs, while also helping to boost local markets. Another reason for Candlelight to apply cash transfer are the reduced facilitation costs, as mobile transfers do require less administrative costs. The cash values to be transferred on a monthly basis are provided by the Cash Working Group (CWG) Somalia based on minimum expenditure basket (MEB) as per region across Somalia. The latest food cash transfer values for families in Awdal are USD 90 (October - December 2019)\n\nThe target group for the UCT will mainly be the rural and most vulnerable families facing high levels of food insecurity among other vulnerabilities. The timeframe for UCT to be disbursed will be 4 months to stabilize food security levels in the lean and Ramadhan seasons. The major activities for UCT will start with sharing selection criteria in a transparent manner with village leaders and communities. \n\nA local telephone company (Telesom) with extensive experience of conducting cash transfer to beneficiaries in remote areas will be commissioned to conduct monthly cash transfers to beneficiaries mobile phones. The beneficiaries who may not know how to use the services will be trained on how to use it. \n\nFor conditional cash transfers relating to Cash for Work (CfW) activities, the project will follow a similar selection and disbursement cycle. As part of CfW, the project will, village cleaning campaigns and rehabilitation/ replanting of mangrove forests especially in Toqoshi and Zeyla villages to provide for sustainable communal livelihood assets that enhance collective resilience. The individual sites for CfW activities will be identified together with the communities. The CfW beneficiary selection criterion will be their physical capacity in conjunction with the vulnerability of their families, such as families with more than three children, or families who lost major parts of their livestock and livelihoods. The families with men eligible for CfW might not be as vulnerable as the families receiving the UCT, however they have a risk of sliding into crisis mode. Beneficiaries shall be paid at a rate of approximately 7 USD each based on a standard piece of work but each beneficiary working for atleast 13 days in a month. Each 50 Cash for Work beneficiaries will be supervised by 1 foreman who will be paid a slightly high rate of approximately 10 USD each working day.",

The 750 beneficiaries will receive UCT amounting to a food transfer value of US $100 for 4 months to support a food purchase that meet the minimum 2100 kcal/person/day.\n\nThe project proposes lifesaving interventions that are gender sensitive, adapt centrality of protection and that mainstream gender and protection in the delivery methods proposed. The project will specifically prioritize destitute pastoralists and IDP households, women from the destitute households left behind in identified accessible settlements (hard to reach areas especially such as rural areas of the Adado Districts) and other households as identified in the Adado District that fall into the IPC 3. The planned project activities will help mitigate the effects of the poor recovery from the 2016-17 drought that were followed by below average Deyr 2018 and Gu 2019 season rains in Central Somalia Region. The project will also support the Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) from Haradhere District who have sought refuge in Adado District after being displaced by the Non-State Actors keen on forcibly recruiting the children (boys) to be trained in their militia and also being forced to part with their animals on what amounts to illegal taxation for the Zakaat.\n\nThe project seeks to improve households\u2019 immediate access to food to 750 vulnerable households in Adado District of Galgadud Region through Unconditional Cash Transfers (UCTs) for 4 months.  The project will undertake a vulnerability assessment in selected locations of the targeted 6 locations in the District (3 settlements with IDPs and 3 settlements with high number of vulnerable host households) with the findings being used in developing the criteria for selection of the planned UCT beneficiaries and informing on protection needs.  Priority for the UCTs beneficiaries will be given to women-led households from the most vulnerable among recently displaced and socially marginalized communities in the District. The UCTs planning will also be supported by a market analysis undertaken in the District (undertaken by the FSL Team) to determine the capacity of local markets to absorb the resources extended to the beneficiaries. \n\nThe project will provide for continuous community engagement during the implementation process to ensure that the project gets feedback from the beneficiary community necessary for determining the effectiveness of the response and arising gaps that will require humanitarian response. This is particularly necessary given the prediction of a possible effects of the locusts that are expected to spawn again with the coming Gu 2019 season. In addition the project will monitor the trends of COVID-19 pandemic and support groups that may be at risk of a lockdown in case of an increase in food prices given the interruption of supply chains as will be authoritatively captured authoritatively captured by WFP Somalia in its Supply chain monitoring briefs.  The project will also mainstream gender and protection components in order to ensure it supports inclusiveness of both genders but in particular helps make women a priority in the design as direct beneficiaries ensuring the resultant benefits of the project accrue to them.

        "description": "The proposed project aims to mitigate acute watery diarrhea (AWD) and cholera outbreaks in Beletweyne through the scale-up of early warning systems (EWARs), case management, and filling critical health gaps. RI is currently supporting the cholera treatment center (CTC) in Beletweyne and will strengthen surveillance and referral to specialized AWD/cholera treatment through a network of four static health facilities and one mobile health team.  Community awareness and mobilization campaigns on AWD/cholera will be conducted through activities such as mass media campaigns (radio and billboards), health and hygiene promotion at health facilities, community outreach through a cadre of trained health promoters, and leveraging community health committees to disseminate critical messages on outbreak prevention. In collaboration with the Ministry of Health (MOH), the project will also strengthen and expand early warning disease detection mechanisms to mitigate, detect, and respond to disease outbreaks in a timely manner. Case tracing from health facility data with ensure the timely follow up and mitigation before outbreaks occur. \n\nThe project will deliver the Essential Package of Health Services (EPHS) to fill the critical maternal, reproductive, and child health service gaps and treat communicable diseases, common illnesses, HIV/STIs, and tuberculosis. Hygiene promotion activities will specifically reach households with sick and malnourished children through targeted and timely health and hygiene messages. At the four proposed static facilities, clinical staff have been trained on clinical management of rape (CMR), GBV referral pathways, psychosocial support (PSS), and data confidentiality. Each proposed health facility serves as an entry point to the connected women\u2019s and girls\u2019 safe space where vulnerable women and girls may, upon request, access PSS and referrals to specialized GBV services including CMR \n\nMultiple feedback channels will be established to ensure accountability and responsive programming. RI will communicate the availability of all feedback mechanisms and beneficiary right to share. RI adheres to the Somali Treatment Guidelines, actively participates in cluster and coordination meetings, submits data on a monthly basis, and relies on national and MoH staff expertise to implement program activities. Through close collaboration with other partners in Beletweyne, RI will work to minimize redundancy and maximize impact.",

        "description": "According to FSNAU Post Deyr 2019/2020 technical assessment, the overall health, food security and nutrition needs remain significant within most parts of Somalia with an estimated 43% of rural Nugal and Burtinle population in urgent need of humanitarian assistance (73,433 people, among them 2,073 in emergency, 21,350 in crisis and 50,010  being stressed. Nugaal region has consistently reported poor maternal amp child health and nutrition indicators ridden by high child and maternal morbidity rates, crude mortality rates and under 5 mortality rates. In December 2019, EPHS project that supported health and nutrition intervention in Nugaal came to a close. This left ta gap in health and nutrition in Nugaal. The Proposed project  will therefore bridge the major essential health care service gap that currently exists in Burtinle following the close out of the EPHS Project. The  project will  address the identified gaps in nutrition and health, enhancing access to integrated basic health and nutrition care services within their localities aimed at improving the physical and mental well-being of boys, girls, men and women in the targeted locations.  These specific needs have been outlined in the HNO, HRP and FSNAU and MOH gaps identified in the targeted locations. The proposed project is geared towards reducing the vulnerability of the beneficiaries and communities. World Vision Somalia (WV Som)  will work  with MOH to address the health and nutrition gaps identified. The services will be both preventive and curative targeting vulnerable men, women, boys, girls and persons living with physical disabilities in the 2 targeted districts. 1 Mobile and outreach implementation models will be adopted to address the unique needs of vulnerable beneficiaries in remote and geographically isolated populations in  Burtinle district.  Screening for malnutrition will be carried out and children with SAM will be treated in OTP sites. Children with MAM will be  registered through SCOPE to access  TSFP that is supported by WFP. Children diagnosed with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) with medical complication will be referred to the  SCs that World Vision propose to support in Burtinle  district.  At each of the 4  MCHs, WVI shall establish basic reproductive health care services aligned within the MISP framework, utilizing the ambulances to refer mothers with complications from the MCHs and PHUs to the hospitals. At each PHU WV shall build the capacity of the community midwives to provide basic reproductive health care services in remote hard to reach areas as a mitigation measure against preventable maternal morbidity and mortality. While engaging community volunteers, WV shall adopt Timed and targeted counselling (TTC) approach focusing on pre conception to the first 1000 days of a child\u2019s life also incorporating the Finish baby kit and Fortified rice and lentils (Vitameal) as a motivator for adoption of promoted health seeking practices among WCBA through enhancing access to Reproductive health care services, child health including Immunization ,IYCF and hygiene promotion care and care-giver led MUAC screening and referral . At 4 targeted MCHs and PHUs WV has an already established GBV care system with personnel already trained and necessary CMR supplies in place to respond to GBV cases.  World Vision will ensure that beneficiaries visiting the targeted facilities including beneficiaries served at the mobile sites access a comprehensive basic package of services .Towards health and nutrition promotion, World Vision will focus on NHHP, care-giver led MUAC screening that will be done at the project sites with the nutrition beneficiaries is linked with the food security and safety net interventions to enhance household food basket.",

It is also contributing to the cluster priority of filling critical gaps in health care services for populations facing high incidence of malnutrition and service gaps.\nThe project has also been designed with full awareness of the prevailing gender norms and deeply rooted gender inequalities in Somalia that limit women and girls from accessing basic services such as health and nutrition, and expose them to a higher risk of GBV. In order to address these challenges, Save the Children will identify and work to remove the physical, cognitive and social barriers by collaborating closely with the communities and particularly the influencers and gatekeepers. We will also address the intersectionality of vulnerability factors, for example women with disabilities or from minor clans who are likely to face multiple levels of discrimination.\nThe project will contribute to improving equitable access to quality life-saving curative and preventative health and nutrition services through the support of static health facilities complemented by mobile outreach services. There will be one integrated health and nutrition mobile team in Garowe district. The integrated health and nutrition mobile team will provide outpatient consultations, routine immunizations, maternal healthcare, disease surveillance and health promotion as well as systematic identi\ufb01cation, referral and treatment of acutely malnourished cases by providing integrated nutrition services to out-patient therapeutic programme (OTP), Targeted Supplementary Feeding Program (TSFP) and stabilization centers. The provision of OTP services for those with Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) and the referral and treatment of SAM cases with medical complications to the nearest stabilization centre. Micronutrient supplementation, promotion of Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF) practices, promotion of adoption of good hygiene and sanitation practices will be done, providing treatment for all age groups, both male and female. The health and nutrition interventions will improve early identification and prevention of malnutrition, and access to primary health care, and therefore reduce excess morbidity and mortality. As part of gender and social norms transformation we will ensure that the activities include positive messaging for men in their roles as fathers. Women and girls will be seen by health practitioners of the same sex and consultations and documentation will be kept confidential.\nSave the Children (SC) will support nine fixed facilities in the following locations Waabari MCH, Gabmbool MCH, Gargar MCH, Jilab MCH, Barwaaqo MCH,Bahnano 1 MCH, Bahnano 2 MCH, Hanano MCH and Awrculus MCH    with integrated health and nutrition services in addition to the mobile and iCCM services. SC will carry out regular safety audits of the facilities to identify and mitigate the risks faced by women and girls in accessing services and resources.\nWe would like to note that Save the Children is working closely with partners to monitor and respond to the ongoing COVID 19 pandemic and will plan to modify and adapt programme activities according to the emerging situation if necessary. Save the Children will be considering the four following dimensions and is currently developing plans for staff health, business continuity, programme preparedness and programme response.",

        "description": "Trocaire has been the main provider of Health services in Gedo since 1992, operating all main hospitals in northern Gedo in partnership with District Health Boards and, more recently, the Ministry of Health. This proposed intervention will provide integrated lifesaving Health and WASH services to 3,987 men, 3,767 women, 3,588 boys, and 3,404 girls from Burdhubo location in Garbaharey district. These will include approximately 7,373 IDPs, 7,373 host community members, and 730 individuals with different forms of disability. Trocaire will work closely with the government District Medical Officers, the Burdhubo District Health Board, the District Commissioner's office, other implementing partners and with coordination through the Health and WASH clusters. Coordination will be prioritized as it remains a key assumption of the project for effective and efficient delivery of integrated lifesaving assistance to vulnerable and marginalized populations in Burdhubo. Health interventions aim to provide primary and essential lifesaving services in an inclusive manner. With a few private health facilities in Burdhubo, the population remains under-served, with children, pregnant and lactating mothers facing unimaginable challenges as they walk long distances of up to 40 kilometres to access health services. Trocaire will therefore work with the above stakeholders to re-establish affordable, accessible, and inclusive health services to both vulnerable IDP and host communities. This will require minor rehabilitation of 1 static health facility- Burdhubo Health Centre, and equipment and management of 1 mobile outreach team that will access beneficiaries in 5 outreach sites. Waiting shades will be constructed in these five sites to ensure dignified assistance is provided in a safe, accessible environment. Health workers will be trained to handle different components of health activities including Clinical Management of Rape, immunizations, emergency trauma care, communicable disease treatment, TB screening and treatment etc. Specialized services, which require referral to nearby hospitals, will be facilitated. The Trocaire-managed health facility in Garbaharey town will be the main referral point, as it is equipped as a referral hospital.\nWASH services will complement health services through relations with the health outreach teams, working closely to reduce morbidity and mortality rates, as well as reducing cases of malnutrition. Preventive approaches will be utilized through 11 hygiene promotion sessions with community-based staff/ volunteers. Hand-washing practices will be promoted through distribution of 1,000 hygiene kits through restricted cash vouchers in collaboration with the WASH cluster hub, as well as other partners on the ground, if any. According to assessment data collected in early March 2020, about 90 percent of the population in Burdhubo use untreated and unsafe water from the river, which is also too far a distance for most of the HHs. Within this project, Trocaire will seek to construct one hybrid shallow well with water treatment encouraged at the household level to encourage uptake of safe and clean water. One representative Water-User Management Committees (WMCs) will be set up to manage the shallow wells created. 70 emergency latrines will be constructed and hand-washing facilities with soap installed. Hygiene promotion sessions will be held. Trocaire is discussing with other partners to ensure that once this project is operational there will be opportunities to continue implementing necessary services, and working closely with the local, regional and national stakeholders to ensure that they are well equipped to continue provision of these services, when time is right for Trocaire to exit.",

        "description": "Evictions represent a unique protection challenge in Somalia with far-reaching consequences on physical security, dignity, and livelihood of victims. Bossosa is one of the epicenters of the problem as the region struggles to recover from the residual effects of the 2016-17 drought amid persistent insecurity, cyclic natural disasters, and widespread unlawful evictions. At the national level, Somalia is faced with the daunting prospect of rebuilding the country having been riven by more than two decades of conflict and lawlessness. Important strides are being made to address the issue but ongoing initiatives have been outmatched due to the prevalence of the problem, thus necessitating a more robust, integrated and coordinated program response. In the absence of an effective response to address protection challenges that are being exacerbated by eviction, displaced communities will remain at risk of continuing secondary displacements. Efforts to strengthen protection and contribute to durable solutions to displacement in Bossaso will be incomplete and/or undermined without addressing the issue of eviction concurrently and systematically. The project seeks to contribute towards ensuring that individuals affected by displacement receive support assistance to improve their tenure security situation and address post-eviction complications.\n\nThis action builds on NRC\u2019s hands on expertise in evictions prevention and response programming in Somalia, and targeting 37,198 individuals in Bossaso, the project seeks to enhance the protection of displaced communities at risk of eviction and to create an enabling environment for sustained recovery and the pursuit of log lasting solutions. This overarching objective will be achieved by implementing a combination of complementary activities aimed at reducing the practice of unlawful evictions, strengthening tenure security among displaced communities at highest risk of eviction, and consolidating the protection of HLP rights. Priority actions include supporting the establishment of dedicated evictions prevention capacities at the municipality of Bossaso, replicating eviction programming best practices at the municipality, helping victims cope with post-eviction stress through cash, and strengthening local dispute resolution capacities and fostering social cohesion in target communities. A parallel objective of the HLP Sub Cluster which this project will seek to advance is consolidating HLP capacity among national organization.\n\nA combination of deliverables will contribute toward the mitigation of protection risks exacerbated by evictions through integrated prevention and response initiatives ensuring that displaced communities have increased access to information and specialized services necessary to navigate administrative and procedural obstacles linked to the enjoyment and exercise of HLP rights and supporting local mechanisms to address HLP violations and contribute to social cohesion.",

According to joint assessments conducted by NRC, AVORD and NRC in March 2020, the humanitarian situation in Xudur is dire and require immediate attention. Generally, Xudur faces serious humanitarian challenges as the district cannot be easily accessed by humanitarian actors safe for a small radius of about 25kms from the main town. Al Shabaab operations remain high and the security situation is in unpredictable. The already congested IDP sites are receiving new influx on daily basis burdening the already fragile. Water, Protection, Shelter and security issues were the greatest needs among the IDPs and displacement affected communities. Almost 80% of the IDPs have lost their assets as well as means of livelihood such as farming and livestock and are unwilling to return their places of origins. Water supply and sanitation services are needed, only 1/3 of the population have access to the already overwhelmed sanitation services, while over 70% of go out for open deifications.

As part of lessons learnt in late 2019 during which Somalia has experienced one of the most devastating floods in history, AVORD will ensure that relief items are readily available for immediate distribution to affected households, as needed. \n\nUnder the proposed initiative, 5,650 NFI kits will be distributed to stressed communities in humanitarian crisis in Baidoa including the newly arrived and evicted households. The target group include 8,136 men, 10,848 women, 4,068 boys and 4,068 girls from the IDP community and 2,034 men, 2,712 women, 1,017 boys and 1,017 girls from host communities. Of the target group, an estimated 1,017 men, 1,356 women, 508 boys and 509 girls will be targeted based on disability. In-line with shelter cluster standards, each NFI kits will contain critical relief items such as 1 Plastic Sheet, 3 Blankets, 2 Sleeping Mats, 1 Kitchen Set, 1 double Mosquito Net, 1 Solar lamp and 2 Jerrycan with the capacity of 10 liters each. Where market conditions allow based on survey data, AVORD will adapt a Cash-based approach to implementation otherwise, an in-kind, direct distribution modality will be adapted. Disbursement of relief items will be made in close coordination with the shelter cluster to ensure that available stocks are used to respond to crisis and that activities contribute to the attainment of cluster strategic objectives. In each distribution, priority will be given to most vulnerable households in humanitarian emergency including the disabled, the chronically-ill, female headed households and families with the largest number of children under the age of 5. Full beneficiary details such as contact information will be captured throughout the process to facilitate monitoring activities and ensure that aid is given to those in need. Within 4 to 8 weeks of each distribution, a Post Distribution Monitoring Exercise (PDM) will be conducted to assess the effectiveness of the response and document lessons learnt. \n\nIn the delivery of the proposed package, AVORD will seek integration with own interventions in the region and with other humanitarian partners including NRC and DRC with whom AVORD has signed a memorandum of cooperation, to ensure complementarity, value for money and efficiency of the response.",

They will be distributed to newly arrived IDPs, protracted IDPs and affected host who did not receive any assistance in 2019 or early 2020 and mainly affected by flood. The target population (women, girls, men, boys, elderly and people with disabilities) living in the IDP site reside in small makeshift structures made of sub-standard materials that jeopardize their physical security, privacy, and from vagaries of nature and diseases. \n\nUnder this project, HAPEN will distribute 3954 NFIs and 3954 ESKs as in-kind to 9 IDP site in Gedo region Dollow: (Kabasa = 655, Qansahley = 550, Host 100), Luuq: Jazeera =314, Xero kowad= 470 and Boyle=420 Host =100), and Garbahrey: (Towfiq =270, Tula qorah =345, Hashi Weer =380, Tafta taag =250 and Host 100).\n\nBeneficiaries will be selected through a participatory process driven by a representative project and site management committees while ensuring marginalized groups interests are catered for and vulnerable approach, considering issues such as women-headed and child-headed households, orphans, disabled, the old among and new arrivals, protracted, and distribution.\n\nThe proposed intervention targets 3654 IDP HHs (21,924 IDP persons) and 300 IDP host HHs (1,800) in Dollow, Garbaharey and Luuq. The protracted IDPs targeted are those living in Grabahrey. These families belong to most vulnerable IDPs who live in makeshift buuls without adequate access to NFIs and Emergency Shelter. \n\nFollowing a need-based and transparent selection of beneficiaries and on local market conditions, HAPEN will facilitate a direct-distribution program through which targeted IDPs and select host communities will receive ESKs and NFIs. HAPEN will employ an owner-driven approach in the construction of emergency shelters by capacitating the IDPs to undertake the construction process.\n\nProtection and GBV concerns will be factored during site selection and will be integrated in all aspects of the response. Proper site planning will be undertaken to ensure effective mitigation of hazards and reduce alarming congestion levels in target settlements.\n\nOn monitoring and evaluation, Post Distribution Monitoring (PDM) and Post Construction Monitoring (PCM) will be conducted after distribution and construction respectively. Therefore, two PDM exercises will be conducted for the two phases of NFI distributions. The monitoring exercise will provide beneficiary feedback on the effectiveness and collate lessons of the distribution. 90% of the beneficiaries will take part in the exercise to ensure proper representation and accurate reflection on the process and quality of the intervention. \n\nThe PDM will support measuring beneficiary satisfaction of the items distributed and identify the needs and feelings of the community better. The exercises will inform on the effectiveness of the activities and achievements of targets while providing guidance towards the overall objective. \n\n3 Community Response and Feedback Mechanism (CRFM) desks, one for each district of operation will be established, in addition to the hotline and PDM /PCM. COVID-19 preventative mechanisms will be adopted in CRFM and during distribution to minimize any occurrence of infections.\n\nThe desks will be manned by two personnel and the anticipated data to be collected include among others both compliments and complaints: the quality of the ESKs and NFIs, beneficiary selection processes, shortness of items distributed, delays and other unexpected feedback. HAPEN\u2019s staff will analyze the collected data and respond accordingly. This will ensure that community participation and AAP are enhanced.",

        "description": "This project is intended to address the emergency shelter and NFIs needs of 2,216 IDP families (13,296 persons) of newly conflict and flood affected population as well as the most vulnerable protracted IDP families for life-saving in both districts \u2013 Afgoye and Marka \u2013 Lower Shabelle region.  With the presence of the Somali National Army (SNA) and AMISOM, Al Shabab, and clan militia, the security situation in the region had become more volatile than it was before. Security operations carry out by SNA and AMISOM alongside the USA drone airstrike targeting Alshabaab Militia caused humanitarian consequences to the civilians in the region. Within March 2020, joint forces SNA/AMISOM took over Janale village as a strategic business center it is about 13KM to Marka district. As a result, an estimated number of 3,200 HHs mainly women, children, and elderly people have fled from Janale to the IDPs in Marka, Afgoye villages as well as Mogadishu to escape from the violence. \nThus, based on findings from rapid needs assessment through direct surveys of IDPs in Marka villages and telephone interviews with IDPs in Afgoye villages conducted by HINNA team in the region, this project is assigned to address emergency shelter and NFIs needs of 2,216 IDP families (13,296 people) of the newly conflict and flood affected population including those protracted IDP families who have recently received any shelter and NFIs assistance in 10 IDP sites in the areas with high severity and people in need \u2013 5 in Afgoye namely Aytire, Baalguri, Damaley, Sagaalaad, and Mareereey and 5 in Marka namely Buulo Samoow, Buufoow Bacaad, Moallin Ali, Abukar Same, and Cell Fareey who are in dire need of shelter and NFIs assistance as they live in bushes that endanger their lives and dignity. During beneficiary registration, the project will give more priority to most vulnerable and marginalized groups such as IDPs with larger families, families with disabled and elderly persons, female headed-households and etc.\nAlthough markets in both districts are functioning the main challenge is that IDP settlements are far from them. However, according to the preference of project target IDP community including existing camp management committees, camp leaders and local authorities who participated in consultation meeting conducted through direct observation and phone interviews about the modality of assistance, this project will use in-kind distribution modality of 2,216 ESKs and 2,216 NFIs to project direct target beneficiaries of 2,216 HHs (13,296 persons) in both districts. In the context of COVID 19, decongestion and site planning/rearranging shelters will be considered in consultation with IDP communities and in close coordination with the cluster. \nDuring the implementation, the project will ensure using cluster guidelines to improve the living condition of the targeted beneficiaries by restoring their privacy, protection, and dignity. Post Distribution Monitoring (PDM) will be conducted four to six weeks after to assess the quality of the distribution and process, utilization, and its immediate impact in saving lives and the satisfaction of beneficiaries about the NFI items distributed and/or the shelters constructed and it's quality. This will help us know more about the future preference of IDP communities.\nThe main objective of the project is to ensure that 13,296 persons (2,216 HHs) of newly displaced, and protracted IDPs affected by conflict and natural disasters have the protection from the weather and have privacy through the provision of 2,216 Emergency Shelter (ESKs) and 2,216 NFI kits to 2,216 households (13,296 persons: (1,728 men, 2,925 women, 3,324 boys, and 5,319 girls)). The project will ensure full coordination among humanitarian service provides especially shelter cluster partners who are working in the project areas in order to avoid duplications.",

        "description": "In close coordination with NRC and DRC, AVORD has developed this proposal with the aim of delivering a holistic, integrated response to provide life-saving services to vulnerable communities in Xudur. As elaborated in the attached teaming agreement, AVORD will take lead in the provision of Non-Food Items, emergency shelters and CCCM services in Xudur while DRC and NRC will undertake complementary WASH and Protection activities respectively. Tentative implementation arrangements have been endorsed by the three agencies with a commitment to coordinate closely and target a similar target group, hence maximizing impact and efficiency of this response.\n\nUnder the present proposal, AVORD will distribute NFIs on-Food Items (NFIs) to 4,700 IDP and host community households (estimated 28,200 persons) who live in extremely poor shelter conditions. The target group include 6,768 men, 9,024 women, 3,384 boys and 3,384 girls from the IDP community and 1,692 men, 2,256 women, 846 boys and 846 girls from host communities. Of the target group, an estimated 846 men, 1,128 women, 423 boys and 423 girls will be targeted based on disability. Each registered household will be provided with 1 NFI kit comprising of 1 Plastic Sheet, 3 Blankets, 2 Sleeping Mats, 1 Kitchen Set, 1 Mosquito Net, 1 Solar Lamp and 2 Jerry Cans with the capacity of 10 Liters each. In addition to NFIs, emergency shelters will be constructed for 250 newly arrived IDPs and those living in the open. In the construction of these shelters, the project team will ensure adequate separation between individual household shelters and that pathways exist to provide all-weather access to individual dwellings and facilities. AVORD will closely coordinate with district officials and relevant line ministries at state and national levels to secure land tenure for a minimum of 3 years. The number of emergency shelters to be constructed under this project has been limited to 250 since the majority of IDPs reside in private land, making it difficult to secure enough space for the construction of a large number of shelters. However, it is anticipated that IDPs will be able to use the plastic sheets that will provided as part of the NFI kit to repair damages to their current shelters.\n\nWith regards to CCCM, AVORD will setup and strengthen camp governance structures where necessary to enhance information-sharing and trigger system-wide coordination among service providers. Key program activities also include construction of 2 culturally-appropriate multi-purpose social halls to provide space for improved coordination and effective management of sites. Periodic service mapping, site monitoring and safety audits will be undertaken in close coordination with NRC, DRC, the CCCM cluster and other humanitarian partners in the area to effectively address existing gaps and maximize efficiency of the humanitarian response. Site maintenance committees in target settlements will be equipped with a range of site maintenance tools and supplies before engaging in cash-for-work schemes through which community-led site upkeep and maintenance activities will be carried out.\n\nAVORD will adapt systematic approach to beneficiary selection with a clear criterion to prioritize the marginalized, single headed-households, large families and/or families with children under the age of 5, women at risk as identified by protection officers and those with special needs. Data collected to inform beneficiary selection will be segregated by gender to ensure that no group is left-out. List of beneficiaries along with their contact numbers will be availed to SHF and other actors responding in the area to avoid overlap. The effectiveness of the aid package will be ascertained through Post Distribution Monitoring exercise thus ensuring that beneficiaries access their services safely and in a dignified manner. An elaborate feedback and complain mechanism will be setup to ensure accountability to the affected population.",

        "description": "IDP communities in Bardera face cyclical scarcity to safe and sufficient water due to abnormal dryness and floods. At this critical moment, vulnerable communities rely on unsafe water for drinking and domestic use, leading to increased health risks and poor living standards. Floods further undermine the sanitation services available in Bardera. During the most recent floods in October 2019, 90 percent of latrines were non-functional due to the floods leading to high rates of open defecation and increased incidences of water-borne diseases. To reverse the negative impact of recent natural hazards and increase the resilience of Bardera IDP communities, a sustainable WASH intervention capable of withstanding these shocks and improving living standards is vital. \n\nACTED will respond to this compounded risk by implementing a market-based project in six largely underserved and high-WASH risk IDP sites in Bardera, including Bulo Ceesan, Bulo Garass, Liban, Xabalcadey, Horseed and Kulmiya IDP sites, and will serve 2634 households (15804 individuals). To ensure the sustainability of this action, ACTED will collaborate with the private sector to extend existing water networks to these communities and where necessary construct new water assets. Moreover, ACTED will construct flood-resistant and gender-sensitive latrines to ensure year-round use as well as the distribution of WASH vouchers, establishment of WASH Management Committees and hygiene sensitization sessions. The full suite of activities aims to meet both the acute and long-term needs of the vulnerable IDP communities, whilst establishing relationships with the private sector for continued maintenance and operation of these assets.",

This approach will be useful to create synergies of services and expertise within the same location and same population leading to achieving a greater impact. The interventions will support the targeted communities holistically and efficiently by providing well-tailored and packaged responses to address different needs of the people of concern. The integrated response is in line with SHF principles by prioritization direct implementation and supporting the integration of response across clusters. \n\n10 settlements will be targeted by all agencies (the name of these settlements are mentioned in attached Annex-3) and will reach 17,131 individuals (50% females) through WASH interventions that includes rehabilitation of existing productive shallow wells and installing them with complete Solar pumping system, construction of water storage facilities and distribution points. The project will improve sanitation and hygiene conditions of the target communities through construction of 450 family shared latrines with handwashing facilities, training of community based hygiene promoters to undertake awareness creation along with distribution of 1350 hygiene kits to displacement affected families. DRC will provide Protection assistance whereby AVORD will provide Shelter and CCCM assistance to the same beneficiaries. After the approval of the project, NRC and DRC will do joint needs assessment both in the district to select the most vulnerable settlements for interventions. Through this project, NRC will reach 17,131 individuals. Post Distribution, Monitoring (PDM) and post construction exercises will be carried out after 6 weeks of wash NFIs and construction of latrines to analyse the impact of the project.",

        "description": "In Lower Juba region and across Somalia, there are multiple threats to the health and resilience of the population due to inadequate WASH facilities. For water supply, Afmadow population is dependent on a mix of unprotected surface water sources and protected groundwater sources. Surface water sources are seasonal and usually contaminated, while protected groundwater supplies are either difficult to access to due to distance and/or not affordable due the high costs of extraction and the dominance of private sector entrepreneurs in their operation, often resulting in rates that the lower income communities cannot afford to access a minimum quantity of water per person per day (Sphere).\nIn this context, ARC will implement a WASH cluster-specific intervention aiming (1) Rehabilitation and/or extension of 5 existing water infrastructures to provide reliable and sustained access to safe water based on identified strategic community water points to flood affected communities in Afmadow district. (2) Establishment of 5 gender balanced water management committees for ensuring continuity of services, appropriate operation and maintenance and as well strengthen women participation in WASH projects. (3) Installation of new and/or rehabilitation of 600 sanitation facilities that are lockable from inside, gender segregated, with hand washing facilities, disaster sensitive with appropriate disaster mitigation features designs. As part of ensuring protection mainstreaming, ARC will install solar light near communal sanitation facilities or if this is not feasible will provide with individual household\u2019s solar lamp/torch. (4) Hygiene promotion campaigns focusing on hand washing with soap and hygiene kits distribution to enhance community sanitation and hygiene awareness and enable good practices. Significant amount of the above proposed WASH activities will be implemented through Market Based Programming (MBP) approach as to strengthen local markets. \n The proposed WASH project will complement set of emergency Health, Protection and livelihood interventions currently ongoing in the targeted areas of Afmadow district through other funding to ensure a comprehensive approach to reduction of morbidity and mortality associated with diseases and hazards resulting from deficient sanitation conditions, the lack of access to safe water and low level of good hygiene practices. ARC\u2019s WASH technical designs adhere to SPHERE standards/Somalia WASH cluster guidelines, mainstreaming protection and disability, gender considerations per IASC guidelines for GBV Interventions in Humanitarian settings as well as the environmental protection considerations and securing access to the elderly and those with special needs as per Handicap International Guidelines. Approximately 24,000 people (4,000 households) will benefit from this intervention. All ARC WASH programs are community led, and leverage stakeholder cooperation to ensure safe, equitable, and dignified access to WASH services for all. Under Health sector, ARC is supporting one MCH (Bosnia) in Dhobley and would start Outreach health services in Afmadow town targeting IDP sites with vulnerable individuals having difficult access to basic lifesaving health services. ARC would also provide un-conditional cash transfer to vulnerable groups in Dhobley for 3 months aiming to improve food security situation as well as the nutrition indicators. ARC\u2019s integrated approach combining the WASH intervention with health and nutrition components ensures greater impact in the area of operation. Adequate WASH improves the overall public health indicators, including the lower incidence of communicable diseases, reduced mother and child morbidity and stronger effects of nutrition interventions as a result of prevention of loss of valuable nutrients from diarrheal diseases.",

PAH, NoFYL and HINNA will implement a multi cluster intervention aiming at 1) CCCM: improving the coordination and information management at site level 2) WASH: addressing sustainable access to water, hygiene, and capacity building needs in this field 3) PROTECTION: mainstreaming protection through (a) preventing and response to eviction, including monitoring threats of evictions by assessing potential eviction sites, monitoring, documentation and reporting to relevant authorities and relevant cluster to mobilize support for advocacy (b) To advocacy and campaigns that aim to ensure lawful eviction processes (c) Capacity development of settlement managers, local authorities in the field of housing, land and proper protection monitoring through ensuring collection of information based on the methodology of the Somalia Protection Monitoring System (SPMS). 4) SHELTER: improving the IDPs living conditions through the distribution of emergency NFI kits and construction of Transitional shelters.\nActivities will be implemented by PAH, NoFYL and HINNA in 2 districts (Kaxda and Deynile) of Banadir region. Activities will target the most undeserved areas of these districts that host mostly newly displaced IDPs due to drought and conflicts. Approximately 17,400 people (3,283 men, 6505 Boys, 9,710 girls and 4,886 women) including 3658 people with disability will directly benefit from this intervention. It will also benefit an entire community working in targeted IDP sites, including local authorities, clusters and other organizations. The multi-sectoral approach and synergies enable the partners to concentrate services and expertise within the same location and same population, leading to a greater impact.\n\nMoreover, PAH acts as WASH Cluster co-lead at national cluster level, NoFYL is part of SRCs and member of CCCM and protection cluster, while HINNA is a member of shelter cluster in Banadir region. This allows to ensure a great capacity for project implementation and a strong understanding of the cluster strategy. Each partner will directly implement activities of their specialization sector. The coordination among partners will be done throughout an entire implementation process to ensure synergies and combine services delivery for all sectors. The partners will jointly conduct periodic monitoring activities to assess implementation of the project, collect feedback from beneficiaries and adjust implementation accordingly if needed. This will be done through harmonized tools that will be developed during the project kick-off meeting. Furthermore, NoFYL, while  providing protection services to IDPs, will also ensure that protection is mainstreamed throughout WASH activities conducted by PAH  as well as Shelter activities conducted by HINNA,  by providing relevant training and ensuring strong coordination.",

        "description": "The proposed 6-month intervention will scale up access to quality basic education through integrating child protection services in IDP and Host community schools in Beletweyne. The project will seek to improve the retention of already enrolled children living in flood-affected areas into the quality and inclusive basic education in a safe and protective learning environment. \n\nThe project will target and support 8,750 children (40% girls) in 20 schools, the most affected schools will be selected in coordination with regional coordinators will receive light rehabilitation and furnishing of desks and chairs, provision of teaching and learning materials to 8,750 learners from 20 schools, provision of dignity kits to 2000 adolescent girls to enhance their daily school attendance, provision of recreational materials to 20 schools that are tailored to the needs of children, Provision of community-based psychosocial support in schools, the establishment of 20 temporary child-friendly spaces (CFS) that will support the provision of PSS, recreational activities and non-formal education activities. On the protection front, the project will identify specific protection needs, inform service provision and serve as an entry point for specialized service provision with boys and girls. Targeted psychosocial support, psychological first aid, case management, and emergency referrals will be provided to child survivors of rights violations, Unaccompanied and Separated Children (UASC), and children who show signs of trauma. 500 children will be targeted for IDTR and PSS provided, of which 30% expected to be reunified with their families. \n\nThe proposed intervention will create synergies with existing programs focusing on child protection. The caseworkers and monitors in the present proposal will act as a reference for the referral pathways aiming at connecting services in the communities. Before starting the implementation, HIWA will coordinate with Shelter, protection, WASH, and CCCM to ensure complementarity and reinforcement of the project approach. HIWA has a strong experience in child protection in emergency and in resilience context and has previously implemented child protection programs funded by UNICEF in Beletweyne and Buula Burte, through this experience HIWA has established linkages with community leaders, local authorities and camp leaders making access and acceptance easier in the target locations. HIWA will coordinate with the regional education cluster during the implementation of the project. Coordination with WASH cluster will be essential in implementing the project, HIWA will work closely with Wash partner who will carry out hygiene promotion in schools and also ensure the water sources in the schools are safe.\n\nOpportunities for cross-sectoral collaboration within and beyond the HIWA education and protection sectors will be sought. The collaboration will include emergency operations with cluster partners to ensure a comprehensive approach and view of education and child protection. HIWA will use the strength of its relationship with the regional education and protection clusters to share information and collaborate in service provision to avoid duplication of activities in the selected schools. Before implementation starts, HIWA will liaise with the regional coordination structure to identify schools that have not been targeted by other partners. HIWA will also closely work with Relief International and Qatar foundation on hygiene promotion and other WASH interventions. Referrals will be directed to them where WASH needs are identified in different schools.",

The food security (FS) intervention will improve the agricultural productivity and minimize the risk of vector-borne diseases affecting crops in flood-affected communities through the provision of direct agricultural inputs including seeds, tools, good agricultural practices (GAP) and vector control trainings and community awareness activities to prevent the spread of crop disease. RI will procure quality, local adapted seeds, appropriate tools and safety gear, and promote environmentally friendly vector control and organic fertilizer approaches. With demonstration plots and other community awareness activities, RI will disseminate GAP and other best practices through the agricultural community to increase productivity, control vectors responsibly, store seeds effectively, and boost livelihoods. To support increased yields and stimulate the local economy, RI will clear and rehabilitate irrigation canals with laborers in a cash for work (CfW) scheme. RI will coordinate with other food security partner to ensure in-kind and/or cash support to The proposed intervention will contribute to a successful late-crop harvest in early 2020 to avert a pre-famine emergency.

HIDIG will leverage of its ongoing WASH and nutrition activities to provide access to an integrated life-saving health services to an estimated 21,000 drought affected and urban poor host communities in Baidoa district through one static health facilities, and six mobile clinics, with a focus on maternal and child Health in partnership with the Ministries of Health and other healthcare service providers. The SHF funds will be used to support a critical response integrated with WASH and nutrition to respond to the health needs of malnourished children and women in Baidoa. The proposed response aims to respond to only areas with critical rates of malnutrition and measles and suspected AWD/Cholera hotspots where immediate provision of lifesaving emergency healthcare is intended to be carried out. For example, Bay region accounts for 48% of all measles cases in South Somalia which make up five regions. HIDIG implemented health project in Baidoa district in partnership with SHF in 2018, which has ended. To build on the gains achieved in 2018 and the ongoing routine immunization support from UNICEF, the proposed project will provide free emergency obstetric care including ANC, skilled delivery and PNC to 1,050 eligible women and improve referral system through provision of timely transportation. Overall, 21,000 direct beneficiaries, including 5,040 girls, 4,200 boys, 6,510 women, 5,250 men will benefit from the services. The organization will conduct routine and supplementary measles immunization targeted at children under-five in target areas. In addition, the capacity of 35 staff will be improved through training so that frontline staff in disaster events marked by a sudden or gradual increase in demand for healthcare services and a related decrease in the supply of resources available to provide such care can act. This will result in a community healthcare-sector response that can implement a variety of surge capacity strategies that include steps taken to reduce demand for care, e.g., the implementation of community-based triage capabilities and risk communication about when to seek care and the strengthening of referral care capacity in addition to better described inpatient care strategies. In this context, fifty community members will also obtain an increased knowledge and skills on community management of childhood illnesses. HIDIG is an active health cluster member in Bay, Bakol and Hiiraan regions and will actively share information with the cluster, UNOCHA and the Ministry of Health, both at state level and federal. The target district is accessible, and the organization has an active PCA with UNICEF in reducing maternal mortality rate through skilled deliveries and strengthening referral system in Somalia. These proposed interventions adhere to the SHf\u2019s life-saving criteria as they respond to time-critical requirements and contribute to reducing the loss of lives. Bay region has more than 12,000 people in IPC 4 and 176,000 in IPC 3, indicating the scale of the acute malnutrition in the region. Because of this, HIDIG requires support and additional resources are urgently required as health and nutrition facilities are seeing more people in need. HIDIG will coordinate its interventions with respective line ministries and other NGOs to ensure there is no duplication in the response and that critical gaps are covered",

        "description": "This project is planned and designed to deliver lifesaving emergency health services including maternal, neonatal and child health through a fixed and mobile health facility targeting women, men, girls and boys from IDP settlements and vulnerable host communities, to reduce acute humanitarian needs and excess mortality among the most vulnerable including IDPs and host community. The project will deliver lifesaving emergency health services including maternal, neonatal and child health through 3 static and 3 mobile health facilities to meet the needs of both host communities and IDPs that are recovering from the effects of persistent droughts and armed conflicts in the district of El-bur  in Galgadud region. \nThe health facilities of El-Bur  district (3 MCHs) that will be supported by New ways with this project will provide ANC, skilled deliveries, PNC, consultation, nutrition status screening and IYCF, hygiene promotion, and treatment of both under and over fives for common illnesses, immunization services, early detection and treatment of communicable diseases, treating people with common mental disorders within the general framework of available health services, ensuring that primary healthcare workers are able to apply key psycho-social and behavioral science skills, as well as ensuring an efficient referral system for those who require more specialized care, Health seeking behavior and hygiene promotion. New ways will organize training of qualified nurses who are member staff of the facilities on mental health in Gur-El for 2 weeks. Facilitators will be brought from Mogadishu. The trained staff will also facilitate the reduction of stigma and discrimination against people with mental illness, which will result in improved demand for services. It will not be easy, but certainly will be a good start for the community. Mental health service integrated into the primary health care services will be of a paramount importance, particularly in El-Bur district, a district that has been at the centre of armed conflict for the last ten years without receiving practically any health service for this entire period of time, let alone mental health service. The project will benefit 36,400 which include 16,761  women, 12,594 men, 3,617 boys and 3,411 girls that includes both vulnerable host communities and IDPs, who will benefit from services delivered by qualified and skilled health personnel. New ways will recruit a medical doctor with \u201cMental health\u201d training, who will be stationed in Guri-El. He will be dealing with referred patient from El-Bur and other patients from the region he will be also supporting people living HIV from our HIV program in Galgadud.",

        "description": "Displacement related to conflict and drought continues to be one of the major driver of humanitarian needs in Puntlnd and in particularly in Taleex and Xudun districts in Sool region.  According to FSNAU post deryr 2018  assessment report indicated that deterioration of  nutrition situation in Sool region with GAM rate (lt15%) due to high morbidity, low immunization ,Vitamin-A supplementation, and poor care practices. Additionally, extreme water and pasture shortages have led to an increased incidence of acute watery diarrhea (AWD)/ cholera outbreaks, which have already been reported in many villages in Sool region. According to rapid assessment conducted by KAALO in February 2019  showed, majority of the health facilities in the assessed villages lacked basic supplies and staff incentives as well as shortage of appropriate reproductive health kits, supplies and commodities. KAALO in partnership with SHF and UNICEF has been implementing an integrated health and WASH project at target location since 2015.The health facilities are facing extreme funding gaps, shortage of supplies and poor referral system. KAALO proposes to scale up its health interventions to save lives, mitigate emergencies, reduce mortality amp morbidity and fill gaps of health services for drought affected people through 2 fixed health facilities with two mobile clinics targeting 28,000 direct beneficiaries including (7000 WCBA, 5600 children under five) in Sool region. The  sexual and reproductive health SRH intervention consists in supporting the provision of basic and comprehensive sexual and reproductive health services to all people at target districts and ensuring particularly the good health and well-being of mothers and newborns. This is done by supporting national health facilities in strengthening the health system strategy, equipping conflict-affected health facilities with emergency reproductive health kits, training health workers IMCI, BEmOC for reproductive health and deploying mobile teams in hard-to-reach areas to directly support the provision of services. Qualified nurses/ midwives will provide preventative and curative services, antenatal care, skilled delivery, postnatal care, treatment of common illnesses. The child health services include immunization of children under five years and promotion services including health education, growth monitoring, de-worming and supplementation with vitamin A. The mobile health teams will provide primary health Services for undeserved and hard to reach areas. They will also provide basic mental health and Psychosocial Support services and referral services. At the end of the project , a total of 28000 affected community (7000 women, 8400 girls, 8400 boys and 4200 men) improved and increased availability of health care including: promotive, preventative and curative services , reproductive health  and improved case management of childhood illnesses through two fixed health facilities with mobile outreach teams in Sool region.",

        "description": "The Nutrition and health situation remains fragile in Hobyo with children and women being most vulnerable. The key issues for children and women remain access to prevention and treatment interventions in the absence of a fully functional health system. Tied to that is minimal capacity available in the nutrition and health sector and  poor community literacy levels  (UNICEF 2018 WHO 2017). Malnutrition is one of the key issues affecting children 6-59 moths and significantly contributing to mortality, considering relationship between malnutrition and disease (UNICEF,2018, FSNAU,2018).\n Although there has been progress noted in service provision and policy development in Somalia including: roll out of national development plan with inclusion of a section on Nutrition and mainstreaming it to sectors (SNDP,2017), 2017-20 health sector strategic plan (FMoH,2017) and other health related policies, frameworks and guidelines,a lot still needs to be done to actualized these.\nIts important to note that disparities in health outcomes among Somali children and women still exist. These are based on: their exposure to violence and insecurity, access, gender and ethnic groupings, and the stability of communities/clan structure. Addressing these inequities, remains a priority (UNICEF,2018). This brings to light the fact that the situation in Hobyo  could be worse than national statistics considering that factors mentioned above fully exist here.\nServices in Hobyo barely reach rural areas because of poor infrastructure and harsh climate conditions. Therefore poor performing indicators like: Poor IYCF, low latrine coverage,low immunization coverage, severe food shortages and poor coverage of nutrition service/health facility are reported (WHO,2018SAF UK,2018 SARA ,2016 FSNAU,2019). There are reports of drought and food shortages causing many to leave there homes in search of food and water. The is therefore need for urgent attention if the situation is to be controlled.\nGender issues that lock out significant others increasing negative social pressure on women not to adapt behaviors beneficial to health, should be addressed for positive nutrition outcomes to be realized. Finally capacity of service providers and locals communities to control malnutrition should be improved for quality service, resilient communities and sustainable projects.\nThe proposed interventions will link with  cluster objective one, two and four, and SHF 2019 1 standard allocation core elements  one,three, four, five and six, which cover provision of immediate life saving and time critical interventions, focus on communities affected by deteriorating nutrition of GAMgt15% , integration of services across sectors, protection mainstreaming and rapid response  enabling the most urgent scaling up of essential humanitarian activities,\nInterventions will also seek to provide primary ,secondary and tertiary prevention for acute malnutrition, build resilience to cushion against shocks in future and provide a platform to discuss and initiate durable solutions  in conjunction with other clusters and relevant bodies thus preventing shocks and ensuring protection.\nSAF UK has been implementing nutrition (OTP,TSFP,MCHN and BSFP) and health projects in north Hobyo for 2 years, but only covering  Afbarwaqo and surrounding villages, reporting huge impact \nThis proposed project seeks to scale up treatment of MAM beyond our current coverage through additional 3 fixed sites in health facilities and 4 mobile sites to access hard to reach areas. Additionally,the current  supplementary feeding project funded by WFP expires on 30th March 2019. We hope to sustain these services (TSFP,MCHN and BSFP) ,avoiding gaps. \nOur proposal is  to provide supplementary feeding interventions (TSFP,MCHN and BSFP)  further integrating with health  project in all proposed sites for cost effective sustainable project",

        "description": ".The 2018 Deyr rainy season (October-December) was poor, with parts of Somaliland and Puntland receiving only 25-50% of average rainfall. Areas of particular concern include Northern Awdal and Woqooyi Galbeed, and Galkacayo IDP which are experiencing emergency (IPC Phase 4) conditions. GAM rates of 10-14.9% are present in Awdal, Woqooyi Galbeed and Togdheer. Similarly, the nutrition situation in Galkacayo IDPs is at a critical level and may deteriorate further without humanitarian assistance. According to the nutrition cluster nutrition burden estimate that was released in February 2019, in Galkayo IDPs, the nutrition situation was at a critical level with a GAM rate of 20.2% which is above the emergency threshold of GAMgt15%. Despite the high (estimated to be 61,092 by the health cluster) caseload of children with acute malnutrition in these regions, access to live saving nutrition services remains limited. In order to address these gaps, the proposed project will improve access and provide nutrition services to children aged 0 to 59 months and Pregnant and Lactating Women (PLW) with acute malnutrition through detection and treatment in the targeted nutrition sites. Particular attention will be on the following activities: Training of Community Volunteers in the identification and referral of malnutrition cases to Save the Children   supported   nutrition centers, and mothers trained in mother-led MUAC to enlarge coverage with close monitoring from Save the Children to prevent wrong referrals and ensure quality of the screening and understanding of the community Provision of Outpatient Therapeutic Feeding (OTP) services for children aged 6-59 months with Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) and Targeted Supplementary Feeding Program (TSFP) for Moderately Acute Malnourished children (MAM) and PLW through mobile outreach teams. Referring children aged 0-59 months identified with SAM coupled with medical complication, and SAM infants aged under 6 months with or without medical complications to the nearest stabilization center. The proposed nutrition project is mainly targeting Galkacayo IDPs (27), Awdal (30) and Woqooyi Galbeed (21) and Digaale and Jimaale HFs in Hargeisa IDPs locations, that are most affected by the current drought in Somalia. The project also promotes and supports optimal Infant and Young Child Feeding practices through the screening of breastfeeding difficulties amongst mothers of children under two years of age, provision of one to one counselling for mothers and caretakers with difficulties with regards to Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF) practices and raising awareness of caregivers and relatives on the importance of appropriate IYCF. The project is targeting 59,971 direct beneficiaries, 27,830 will be from the IDPs while 32,141 beneficiaries will be from the Host Communities. In addition, a total of  96,904 beneficiaries will be reached with key IYCF messages in the targeted areas. The proposed project will incorporate learnings from previous projects on how women and girls can participate meaningfully in nutrition interventions.One of the learnings is that mothers in the IDP settlements a lead role in championing for IYCF interventions once they receive sufficient training, this is because they gained a deeper understanding of the importance of breastmilk to children and were willing to breastfeed exclusively if they had a source of livelihood.Another learning is that women can be powerful agents of change when it comes to hygiene promotion once they understand the benefits of good hygiene practices and this has a positive impact on the whole community particularly as women tend to be the sole custodians of household and child rearing chores.",

The accumulated figure reflect 90% of the total burden of the target districts based on 2019 nutrition cluster burden estimates as well as the projected figures for the first half of the year 2020. \n\nANPPCANSOM will maintain treatment outcomes consistent with Sphere standards using the combined protocol for the management of acute malnutrition in close consultation and coordination with Somali Nutrition Cluster, Somaliland Nutrition Working Group and other nutrition partners including MOHD, UNICEF and WFP. ANPPCANSOM will build on and sustain the delivery of a holistic basic nutrition services package (BNSP) in priority to internally displaced people and their host communities and other socially marginalized groups in pastoral and hard to reach areas while ensuring the inclusion of treatment, promotion and prevention components in this project.\n\nThe project will provide facility-based and community based (BNSP) covering both curative and preventative interventions targeting children U5 years (boys and girls) and pregnant and lactating women. It will support the identification, referral and treatment of children suffering from severe acute malnutrition while SAM cases with medical complications will be referred to the nearest stabilization centers using standard referral forms. ANPPCANSOM will manage 22 fixed OTP sites and 2 stabilization centres (6 OTP fixed sites for Zeila district 9 fixed OTP sites and 1 SC for Berbera district, 6 fixed OTP sites for Hargeisa district 1 fixed OTP and 1 SC for Gabiley district). Efforts will be made to ensure integration of OTP and TSFP sites where possible.  In order to ensure the sustainability of nutrition interventions, local technical capacity will be strengthened by integrating SAM management into the Primary Health Care system through the functional MCH facilities. Additionally, the capacity of nutrition staff will be strengthened for effective service delivery at facility and community level. \n\nIn addition, the project will support community mobilization and screening as well as micro-nutrient supplementation for PLW (multiple micro-nutrients and Iron folate) and Vitamin A supplementation for children between 6-59 months. It will also provide de-worming for children 12-59 months and pregnant women in the 2nd and 3rd trimester as well as counselling and promotion on infant and young child feeding compounded with health and hygiene promotion. Moreover, measles immunization will be provided to infants living within the catchment areas of the target health centers who are not immunized against measles. Systematic defaulter tracing for immunization services will also be conducted at community level. In order to strengthen the accountability with affected population, we will introduce mother-led MUAC approach to increase detection, identification and early referral of malnourished children. ANPPCANSOM will train mothers to use MUAC tapes to enable mothers screen, detect oedema and self-referral of their children to nutrition sites.",

        "description": "It is estimated that Baidoa host over 250,000 internal displaced persons living in overcrowded 371 IDP camps (CCCM cluster report,2018). A large proportion of these IDPs have limited access to protection services including general protection, GBV and child protection services. GBV and Child rights violation is a major concern in Bay region. It is estimated that around 1/3 of all survivors of SGBV in B of deterioration of GBV related services include unavailability of women friendly safe spaces, limited skills of health professionals in providing medical assistance, limited funding, poor legal system and overcrowding among others. As a result, the number of GBV cases reported by partners has increased compared to previous quarter.To ensure the protection and GBV needs are addressed, SAMA proposes the following interventions:\n1. Treatment :  Provide clinical management of rape services CMR and counselling to 300 GBV survivors in Baidao district . SAMA will strengthen two GBV one stop centers in two health facilities to provide Clinical Management of Rape services to GBV survivors . PEP kits will be received from UNFPA. SAMA will consider the needs of women, girls, boys and men separately and focus on identifying gaps and trends to improve programming. \n2. Safe house: Establishing woman friendly safe space in Baidoa district by using the global standard guidelines for establishing Women Friendly Space Place WFSP. The Women friendly space will be considered as referral hub for these affected women. \n3)  Psycho-social Support : Provide Psyco social support (PSS),counseling and referrals for 1200 GBV survivors in Baidao district) this will done through case workers/ Psycoscial support and active community case finding conducted by Social Mobilizers\n4) Social cohesion/community groups :  Establishing community based protection structures (five community based groups and networks - GBV and community watch group) in five locations in Baidao district. Train on protection, GBV prevention amp response,risk Awareness and on personal safety. Beneficiary Selection criteria will be used to select the most vulnerable individuals, households including women headed families, adolescent girls, and people with special needs. Community groups included Village Committee, Women Groups who will be selected from the IDPs and host communities through equal and active participation of women and men their main task is to identify the protection risks, analyses and develop action plans to reduce the risk and prevent the GBV and other protection issue in the community. It will also refer to the available basic services. \n5) solar lanterns: Provide solar powered lanterns and whistles to 300 households whose members are at risk for SGBV, targeting particularly female (70%) and child headed HHs (30%). Provide members of watch groups with flash lights, whistles and visibility material. Beneficiary Selection criteria will be used to select the most vulnerable individuals, households including women headed families, adolescent girls, and people with special needs\n6) Material support : Procurement and distribution of dignity kits to 1000 vulnerable women and girls in Baidoa. \n7) Training: In collaboration with GBV sub cluster, organize CMRS training to 15 nurses/midwives working in GBV stop centers. This will done with UNFPA trained facilitator in line with UNFPA curriculum.\n8) Taring: Conduct refresher training for 20 staff (10 female, 10 male ) on psycho-social support and counselling \n9)Conduct grass root social engagement sessions particularly with adolescent girls on GBV mitigation/reporting. five awareness session and campaigns will be conducted on GBV prevention , awareness on available services, services utilization and referral pathway benefiting 700 affected persons. \n10) In coordination with CCCM and GBV sub cluster , conduct safety audit in six IDP sites using GBV sub cluster guidlines/tools. SAMA will ensure presence of GBV focal point",

This coupled with low levels of community awareness on issues of GBV stigma and other cultural barriers which encourage impunity for breaches in laws and convections. In Kismayo there has been a steady increase in GBV cases since December 2017. This has been attributed to the increasing levels of conflict in Juba land, being one of many active military zones and presence of military frontlines in the identified locations and a high number of IDP camps adjacent to the military camps. Increased forced evictions within the camps have also exposed more women and children to the risk of GBV in the camps thus increasing their vulnerability. \n\nAll the project activities will be carried out to maximize community participation. Regular meetings and capacity building activities at the established women and girl safe space will seek to engage the community in project activities and support the establishment and development of community networks in order to strengthen local mechanisms for prevention and response. By providing support to existing community structures the project will also seek to create women safe spaces to improve protection and to widen support networks.

In drought affected regions, water scarcity and inadequate quality are leading causes of displacement and conflict, particularly in Puntland and Somaliland, where women and children must often travel over 30 minutes to reach drinking water points. Of the people in need and highly vulnerable, a large percentage are children, women and the elderly, who critically lack access to clean water and are acutely at risk of gender-related violence and high morbidity and mortality due to water-borne disease outbreaks. Many households lack access to adequate sanitation leading to frequent open defecation while safety of people, particularly women and children to access latrines and water points remains a serious concern and a serious risk for exposure to violence\n\nAn estimated 2.6 million people across Somalia remain internally displaced, either scattered among host communities in rural areas or living in formal and informal settlements on the fringes of urban areas. Most of the primary IDP settlements are in Crisis or Stressed in the presence of humanitarian assistance in Sanaag IDPs. The climatic situation is exacerbated by conflict in the Sanaag region. According to reports including those from Puntland\u2019s Humanitarian Affairs and Disaster Management Agency (HADMA), the situation remains tense and hostilities could resume. This would create further displacements and insecurity, and be a push factor towards areas where humanitarian actors are responding. \n\nIn this context, ACTED will implement a WASH cluster-specific intervention for IDPs and rural communities in areas affected by drought aiming to 1) Provide reliable and sustainable access to sufficient safe water, based on identified strategic water points and construction of new boreholes 2) Establish an appropriate system for the management and maintenance of facilities, with different groups contributing equitably and 3) Enhance community sanitation.\n\nACTED will implement these activities in Karasharka, Huluul, Habarshiro, Kalshiikh and Elbuh of Sanaag Region Approximately 25,000 people (4,167 households) will benefit from this intervention, in addition to creating synergies for improved coordination and collaboration among WASH stakeholders in the area, including local authorities, clusters and other NGOs. Specifically, ACTED has coordinated with OXFAM, who will be covering Lasanood, El-AFweyne, Kal sheikh, War-idhaad and Garadheg ) and Ainabo.",

        "description": "According to Humanitarian Dashboard (issued on 22 February 2019) by the Somalia WASH Cluster, several regions of Somaliland and Puntland are experiencing severe shortage of water, due to the over-exploitation of already-limited resources and the breakdown of equipment \u2013 the construction and restoration of water points are subsequently needed. The 2018 Deyr rainy season (October-December) was poor, with parts of Puntland receiving only 25-50% of average rainfall. Some regions have experienced drought for several seasons. Bari is among the regions worst affected by poor rains, with large moisture deficits and drought conditions.\n\nThe recurrent drought together with nutrition crises and other natural emergencies combined with poor WASH coverage and influx of internally displaced people (IDP) in target regions of Bari including Ishkushuban, Bosasso (IDPs), Qardho (IDPs) highlight the need for Save the Children to continue providing emergency services to vulnerable communities. \n\nTherefore, Save the Children is proposing a 12 months WASH project targeting drought and conflict affected communities in Bari regions targeting Ishkushuban, Bosasso (IDPs), Qardho (IDPs) to provide immediate life-saving WASH services to the most vulnerable members of the community, reaching a total of 48,889 individuals (men: 14,373, women: 14,960, boys: 9,778 and girls: 9,778).\n\nThe proposed project aims to provide lifesaving emergency and sustainable WASH service through drilling of two new strategic boreholes and rehabilitation of three strategic boreholes complete with hybrid power system (solar and diesel power), distribution systems, storage tanks and new water kiosks, and rehabilitation of rain water harvesting berkeds in rural target communities. The project will also improve overall hygiene and sanitation of the target communities through the construction of 150 shared household latrines  affected by the drought.\n\nIn terms of centrality and mainstreaming of protection, the project targets to reduce the risk of violence against women, children and vulnerable groups while accessing water and sanitation facilities by providing gender segregated facilities and establishing the facilities within 500 meters\u2019 distance of the settlements. The project will also address gender issues by collecting gender and age disaggregated data. Save the Children will analyze this data to identify gaps, provide gender sensitive interventions and ensure participation and empowerment of women. Save the Children will ensure protection during access and utilization of services, to reduce the risk further. \n\nThe project beneficiaries will be selected through a community consultative process with the community leaders and local authorities in order to ensure that only those who meet the specified vulnerability criteria including women and girls, people living with disability, people from minority clans, female headed households,  child-headed households,  survivors of sexual and gender base violence,  and households with a high number of dependents (children, elderly, people with disabilities, pregnant and lactating mothers will be given high priority. Save the Children will maintain and expand synergies across all the programs by ensuring that this project is implemented alongside the other emergency response programs, such as nutrition and health programs, to ensure that benefits arising out of multiple actions to the same target groups are exponentially increased.\n\nThe project is designed in such a way that while providing emergency lifesaving interventions it will also provide longer term sustainable solutions for affected population. To ensure the emergency interventions are linked to durable solutions, the project included construction, rehabilitation and upgrading of water supply systems and promotion",

        "description": "Limited access to safe water in Somaliland is endemic and is worsening with prolonged drought. Poor, below-average rainfall in northern and central Somalia during the Deyr season of 2018 has resulted in a harsher than normal dry season. \nMost water sources across Sool and Sanaag regions in the north are not suitable for human consumption and approximately half of the birkads are damaged, and a quarter of them did not harvest any run-off because of the lack of rains. In addition, poor access to latrines leads to prevalent open defecation across Somalia/land. \nThe aim of the proposed project is to provide lifesaving support to and rebuild resilience of affected communities through providing sustainable solutions to water access. Oxfam prioritizes activities that enable communities to access continued water supply from existing groundwater sources, reduce the walking distance for women/girls to fetch water at a reduced cost, contain human feaces contaminating the environment and surface water sources, and promote behavioural change on personal hygiene and handwashing at critical times.\nOxfam is present in hard-to-reach and in some of the most neglected geographical areas of Sool and Sanaag regions and continues to prioritize presence based on where the highest \u2018unreached\u2019 needs lie. There is a committed and robust humanitarian team (over 30+) in Somalia based out of a main office, a field office, and two sub-offices. The current team has strong technical capacity in response management, with technical coordinators for WaSH and a robust 3-person MEAL team that guides quality and accountability of programming in the field. Working with partners on some interventions/responses, also affords good complementarity in understanding the local context and assuring 2-way sharing of technical knowledge and skills that could enrich growth and progress in addressing the needs of the target population. \n\n2 desalination units are proposed in Oog and Garadag. Oxfam will engage in a public private partnership with Boreal Light (which has expertise in operating desalination plants and can provide operation and management training) and the Somaliland Ministry of Water Resource Development (MoWRD). Oxfam already has good relationships and experience with both parties, having closely collaborated around 2 existing desalination units funded in other areas by other donors. The MoWRD supports and endorses desalination work in Somaliland. \n\nBoreal Light is a leading actor in this sector, specialized in renewable energy solutions for water treatment facilities. It manufactures affordable solar water desalination systems and has extensive expertise in the region, including Kenya and Somaliland. It has identified a local agent in Somaliland who will be responsible for operating, maintaining and managing the desalination units under the SHF project for a period 12 months. The training provided in this time will present a sustainable model after the end of the project period. \n\nTo ensure value for money for this funding and program complimentary, ACTED and Oxfam will coordinate on key activities in Sanaag. At project inception, there will be a training workshop on key learning from WASH programming in the region to share experience: e.g. borehole drilling, sharing supplier lists and good practices in drilling and rehabilitation works, engagement with communities and local authorities. Other topics are likely to cover hydreological surveys, desalination and solarization. WASHCO training to be jointly undertaken after asset completion. Cost savings will be on printing materials, vehicle, and stationary. Joint mapping of WASH facilities in El-Afweyn and Ainabo to assess status of available assets, beneficiaries reached and to analyze gaps and investments necessary to provide support. .A joint MampE exercise will be done twice in the project period.",

        "description": "DRC proposes to undertake a sustainable assistance to Disaster Affected Communities (DACs) through provision of sustainable WASH (water, sanitation and hygiene) services. The SHF activities will complement the CERF emergency health and nutrition activities in the selected locations. The proposed project will also complement DRC's drought-targeted Integrated Emergency Responses in Somalia funded by OFDA. This will enable DRC to provide a complete assistance package to the drought affected communities in selected locations in the North-Western part of Somaliland. The region selected is Awdal which is the most affected region in the north by drought and the Tripical Cyclone Sagar in June 2018, causing displacement and also affecting the strategic water points that communities rely on during the dry spells. Therefore, the WASH assistance package will include - rehabilitation and/or extension of existing water infrastructures construction of new water infrastructures equipping of boreholes with a hybrid pumping system (solar and generator) and distribution networks establishment of water committee to manage water points and ensure their sustainability. Where appropriate, DRC will partner with private borehole owners to supply water to catchment population and sign a tripartite MOU among the private borehole owner, DRC and Local Authorities. Where there are pressing needs especially in crowded IDP camps and among very vulnerable households, DRC will provide household-shared desludgable latrines. The latrines shall be shared among four (4) households. They shall be installed with hand-wash facility, a ramp to allow for easy access for PLDs especially the ones using a wheelchair and shall be installed with a door lockable from inside to ensure women feel secure while using them. DRC is equally piloting sanitation marketing in the south (Dollow and Baidoa), and will apply lessons learnt from these locations to this project. Overall, with rehabilitation of 5 boreholes,construction of 8 elevated tanks and installation of  portable water tanks DRC targets to reach 59,230 people of which 13623 men, 15400 women, 15400 boys and 14807 girls. This population includes 30% IDPs, 60% host community and 10% returnees. The other groups targeted include people affected by cyclone in Awdal considered the coastal population. With 200 desludgable latrines installed with hand wash facilities and sanitation kits, DRC will also reach 4800 people (1104 men, 1248 women, 1248 boys and 1200 girls) with sustainable access to adequate sanitation facilities.",

        "description": "This project aims at providing reliable and sustained access to safe water and adequate sanitation facilities to target population residing in nine riverine villages in Jowhar district that are facing water shortages and have limited access to sanitation facilities. The target population was heavily affected by floods that occurred in 2018 where water supply infrastructures and sanitation facilities were severely damaged and are yet to be repaired. Poor rainfall received during the 2018 Deyr season and the ongoing dry conditions has resulted in critical water shortages and a rapid decline in the remaining water reservoirs in Jowhar district. The river Shabelle that is the main source of water and a vital source of livelihood for communities residing along the river has dried up once again in now four consecutive years.\n\nIn this context, WOCCA will implement a WASH cluster-specific intervention aimed at providing sustained access to safe water through the rehabilitation of 22 strategic wells and fitted with hand pumps. To reduce pressure on the few functioning wells 2 shallow wells will be constructed in Bardheere and Nuukay village. A water distribution system that will include pipeline extension, overhead tank and water kiosk with 8taps and a solar pumping system will be installed in Nuukay village so that more people including neighboring pastoral communities can benefit from the water since the well has a good yield. In Gashaanle village rehabilitation of a shallow well, water tank, kiosk, and installation of a solar pumping system will be done. Identification of these targeted locations for construction and rehabilitation was done in consultation with the community elders and the local authority. The water sources will be located 30m away from latrines to avoid contamination. Dewatering of the rehabilitated/constructed shallow wells and application of shock chlorination will be done to ensure that the water is safe for consumption. \n\nTo strengthen community ownership and ensure sustainability of WASH assets 130 Water management committee members (at least 40% of women) will be trained on operation, maintenance and safe water storage. The project staff and WMC members will be trained on DRR and protection mainstreaming. 310 gender-sensitive latrines with hand-washing facilities, raised to avoid flooding and fitted with locks from the inside to curb GBV will be constructed in the targeted villages. Women, girls and vulnerable groups will be consulted in siting and design of the WASH infrastructures to maximize safety, privacy and dignity. To ensure the WASH infrastructures endure future floods, WOCCA will incorporate DRR aspects in the design of the WASH infrastructures. Sensitization meetings will be held at the inception of the project with all project stakeholders including groups at risk of exclusion to inform them about the project objectives, scope, beneficiary selection criteria, and beneficiary entitlement and roles. Accountability to the affected population will be enhanced through the provision of a feedback hotline to beneficiaries where they can provide feedback and complaints. To ensure quality in the project outputs the project staff will continuously monitor and report on project indicators. WOCCA will also share GPS coordinates of all WASH structures and monthly project reports with the WASH cluster and donor. Signing off and handing over of WASH structures to beneficiaries upon completion will be done through community elders, government officials and religious leaders. WOCCA will also adhere to the principles of \"Do no harm\" through not creating any partial, nepotism, conflict-oriented and sensitive issues within the project beneficiaries.",

        "description": "As Water shortage and poor access to water currently remains the single biggest threat to lives of IDP\u2019s and vulnerable host communities in Hobyo and Galkacyo districts. Humanitarian needs have increased drastically due to below-average Deyr rain in 2018, large-scale displacement and lack of access to basic services. There are no permanent water sources within the IDP settlements hence IDPs rely on berkards which have since dried up, and there is high pressure on the few existing boreholes, already suffering years of neglect and poor maintenance in Hobyo and Galkacyo districts. Pastoralists are highly vulnerable because they are dependent upon rain-fed rangeland grazing for their livestock and tend to have very few fixed assets. The project intends to provide durable and sustainable water and sanitation services to 22,705 IDP\u2019s and drought vulnerable people in Afgaduudle, Madaxdaran, Lascadalle, Tarogee, Qaidaro and Wisil villages by drilling 3 boreholes and rehabilitation of 3 strategic boreholes to provide sufficient safe water increasing access to at least 15 litters per day. The boreholes will be piped within a radius of 1150 meters. The project will also construct 60 latrines to improve sanitation conditions. Construction amp rehabilitation of reliable water sources to the IDP\u2019s and vulnerable host communities will reduce distance and time spent collecting water thus contribute to reduction of AWD for children and GBV among women and girls. WASH committees will also be established/revived/streamlined and trained to strengthen their capacity to manage the operation and maintenance of the new and rehabilitated boreholes and promote good hygiene practices and sanitation within their communities. 60 participants (30% are women) from NGO\u2019s, government and private sector will be selected in mutual collaboration with National and Regional WASH cluster will be trained on diagnostics of ageing boreholes and methods of rehabilitation through 2 workshops in Galkacyo and Mogadishu.",

At least 17 people have died, including 2 children.Belet Weyne district in Hiraan region is worst affected with 231,000 people displaced from their homes. Another 55,000 people have been displaced in Jubaland while heavy rains have affected 30,000 people, many of them women and children. Farmland and infrastructure have been destroyed and livelihoods disrupted in some of the worst-hit areas. The floods have worsened an already complex and prolonged humanitarian situation created by cyclic natural disasters ranging from floods, drought and floods and conflict.\nThe proposed project plans to provide immediate lifesaving health services to populations in Jalalaqsi and B/weyne who have batling with floods that have lead to death, displacement and destruction. Four health centres one per District and four mobile health units attached to the health centers will be scaled up by RRP to deliver basic healthcare more so to mothers and children who have been disproportionately affected by the floods. The project will target 8,500 beneficiaries (5,000 in Beletweyne and 3,500 in Jalalaqsi). It will increase the availability of emergency obstetric care services and increase access to these services for vulnerable populations. Mobile health teams will be utilised to expand coverage and link hard to reach villages affected by the floods to mainstream healthcare services.\nThe project will deliver lifesaving emergency health services including maternal, neonatal and child health through 4 maternal homes/static and 4 outreaches mobile health facilities in flood affected districts of Beletweyne and Jalalaqsi of Hiran Region. Trained staff will provide maternal health services to 5000 and 3500 affected mothers in Beletweyne and Jalalaqsi districts respectively emphasis will be focused on provision of quality services. Emphasis will be laid on Maternal and Child Health, including Basic Emergency Obstetric and Newborn Care (BEmONC) and referral services for Comprehensive Emergency Obstetric and Newborn Care (CEmONC) to the most vulnerable flood affected communities in these two districts. Attention will be paid on application of maternal service delivery guidelines as per EPHS at the PHC. Qualified trained health workers will offer ANC and BEmONC.

        "description": "Amid severe flood conditions that have displaced an estimated 273,000 persons in Hiran and 20,308 persons in Middle Shabelle as reported by OCHA in its Flash Update released on November 6th 2019, AVORD is submitting this time-critical proposal to provide life-saving shelter assistance to most vulnerable households in humanitarian crisis. \n\nIn close coordination with the OCHA-facilitated Multi-Agency Flood Task Force (MFT), AVORD will adapt systematic approach to beneficiary selection with clear criterion to prioritize most affected households especially those from marginalized communities, female headed households and households with the largest number of children under the age of 5, older persons, and/or persons with disabilities. Mindful of the Somali context and utilizing its expertise in target locations, AVORD will pay attention to issues of diversity in the targeting process. List of beneficiaries along with their contact numbers will be availed to the Somalia Humanitarian Fund (SHF) and other actors responding in the area to avoid overlap. \n\n7,300 registered household will be provided with 1 NFI kit comprising of 1 Plastic Sheet, 3 Blankets, 2 Sleeping Mats, 1 Kitchen Set, 1 Mosquito Net, 1 Solar Torch and 2 Jerry Cans with the capacity of 10 Liters each. The proposed content in each set is based on current Shelter Cluster standards for people in humanitarian emergencies. In addition to NFIs, emergency shelters will be constructed for 300 most vulnerable IDPs (150 households in Beletweyn and 150 households in Jowhar). Each shelter will be constructed using assorted local sticks of various sizes, 4 plastic sheets, 1 kg of Nails of size 5, 1 kg of nails size 6, a drum door, door hinges and outer buul clothing, as per the BOQ and technical designs uploaded along with the present proposal. In the construction of these shelters, the project team will ensure adequate separation between individual household shelters and that pathways exist to provide all-weather access to individual dwellings and facilities. AVORD will closely coordinate with relevant line ministries of Hirshabelle to secure land tenure for a minimum of 3 years before the construction of emergency shelters. \n\nThe effectiveness of the aid package will be ascertained through Post Distribution Monitoring exercise thus ensuring that beneficiaries access their services safely and in a dignified manner. An elaborate feedback and complain mechanism will be setup to ensure accountability to the affected population.\n\nIn the delivery of the proposed package, AVORD will seek Integration with other clusters and own interventions in the region to ensure complementarity, value for money and efficiency of the response.",

        "description": "Increased rainfall since the beginning of September in both Ethiopian highlands and within the catchments in Somalia has resulted in a sharp rise in the Shabelle and Juba rivers, leading to severe flooding in southern and central Somalia. According to UNHCR-Protection Return Monitoring Network (PRMN), the recent Shabelle river flooding displaced over 270,000 people, of whom 230,000 are in Beletweyne District. Farmland, infrastructure and roads have been destroyed, and livelihoods disrupted in some of the worst-hit areas. According to the FAO-led Somalia Water and Land Information Management (SWALIM), the rains are projected to continue in the coming weeks and it is expected to end in early December. DRC proposes to undertake a life-saving and sustainable assistance to Flood- Displaced people in Beletweyne through provision of emergency shelter kits (ESK), non-food items (NFIs). DRC will target 2050 households (12,300 people) with ESK and NFIs. The standard emergency NFI package will include plastic sheeting, blankets, sleeping mats, kitchen set, mosquito net, solar lamp and Jerry cans. Where possible, DRC will give the NFIs through cash transfers or vouchers so that beneficiaries can decide based on their needs. DRC will also assist with a standard ESK that contains: Local available stick for vertical post (Philippian Tree) Local available sticks for truss, door and windows (Philippian Tree) or White wood (8cm x 4cm size each) Local available sticks (Philippian Tree) for horizontal frames amp roofing or White wood (5cm x 2.5cm size each) Local available sticks (Philippian Tree) at the base of roof truss or White wood (10cm x 2.5cm size each) Nails No. 5 (5 inch) Nails No. 6 (6 inch) Drum door with frame Hinges for door Local plastic sheet (size: 4m x 7m) and outer wall clothing Buul layer. This provides the most basic shelter which can offer protection from extreme weather. The ESK helps the displaced household to put up by a 4m x 4m shelter structure within the first few days of displacement. DRC is aware that the needs are huge and the available funding cannot cover everyone. DRC is also aware that families of affected persons are normally the first responders and therefore, some families may be better positioned to survive such disaster due to their own social networks. Therefore DRC will develop a selection criteria based on AGD as well as vulnerability to ensure that assistance goes to the ones who deserve it most. Female-headed households, families with many children and the aged (65+ year-olds) will be given priority. DRC will also ensure that, persons living with disabilities (PLDs) or families with such persons are also targeted with assistance.  Families considered extremely vulnerable, will be assisted by DRC to put up their shelter through cash paid after erection. DRC determines that this cash shall be 60 USD and targets 540 hhs out of 2050 hhs. DRC will undertake a post-distribution monitoring (PDM) study four (4) weeks after distribution to measure the effectiveness of distribution and also the satisfaction of the beneficiaries on the items distributed. This will help inform future programming in shelter, NFIs and CCCM programming. Specific to CCCM, DRC shall engage in installation of solar lights and in settlement maintenance including clearance of any solid waste and access roads. DRC will also, jointly with the camp/settlement committees undertake mapping of available services and establish a referral system. Through that, DRC will establish information boards at strategic points like social centers like water points and markets for people to have easy access to information. DRC will support community governance structures through trainings to ensure that camp/settlement committees can manage their daily issues in a structured manner. At sub-national level, DRC will ensure coordination of CCCM meetings happen and deliberations are reported.",

The displaced population is fleeing to high grounds leaving behind household assets completely submerged by water. Safe locations hosting displaced populations lack basic services including safe drinking water and sanitation services. The impact of this is a high incidence of water-borne diseases, growing protection concerns faced by women and girls, conflict activated by sharing of scarce resources and denying the right to access service subjected to people with disabilities, minority groups, and elderly people.\n\nIn this context, PAH will implement a WASH cluster-specific intervention aiming to 1) deliver life-saving WASH assistance to reduce acute need among the vulnerable settlement and communities 2) reduce risk of violence against women, children and vulnerable groups accessing WASH services 3) provide or restore sustainable access to safe water and adequate sanitation services in the targeted communities and institutions.\n\nFloods affected population is farming communities who rely on farming as the main source of livelihood to provide them with income and promote the local economy. PAH has conducted market analysis to assess the capacity of local markets to provide needed WASH items and determine the preference of the affected population. Most interviewed households preferred to be engaged in latrines construction. Based on market capacity and community preference, and building on its previous experience, PAH will construct emergency latrines through cash for work approach selecting skilled individuals from the target population and sourcing construction materials from local vendors pre-identified during the market analysis.\n\n\nTo reduce the negative impact of risky practices and minimize the risk of disease outbreak hygiene kits will be provided to displaced families. The content of the kits will meet cluster standards but will be topped-up with mosquito nets to protect children, pregnant women and elderly persons from malaria. Community-based hygiene promoters will be trained and WASH committees established to promote safe practices.\n\nPAH will implement these activities in the Jowhar district of the Middle Shebelle region. Approximately 13,890 people from 2315 HHs (households) will benefit from this intervention. PAH is one of the main WASH actors fully present in Middle Shebelle implementing emergency and resilience WASH activities in Jowhar and has easy access to crisis-affected locations. PAH is already responding to the flood crisis in Jowhar and is providing lifesaving WASH services including safe water and hygiene kits to 768 displaced people. To address malnutrition PAH is providing 2 months unrestricted cash transfer to 400 most vulnerable families who have lost crops and have malnourished household members. However, the increasing risks and absence of WASH services require immediate scale-up to avert further displacement and disease outbreak. Moreover, PAH will create synergies for improved coordination among WASH stakeholders in the area, including local authorities, clusters, and other NGOs.",

Heavy rains of more than 100mm are expected in Hiraan, Bay and Bakool regions which are already saturated following weeks of continued heavy rains. In South West State, an estimated 70,000 people have been affected and another 40,000 displaced by flash flooding across the region. Berdale town (60 km west of Baidoa) is worst affected. Three quarters of the town is submerged. Local authorities and humanitarian partners estimate that 30,000 people have been affected. The road to Berdale is impassable. Humanitarian partners are working with authorities to scale up the response in the affected areas INTERSOS is targeting to provide emergency WASH response to the floods affected population in Berdale as in line with the needs assessment report conducted by Inter-Agency to quickly identify the vast damages affected by the floods and the priority needs to immediately intervene the humanitarian situation. The report highlighted that around 360 unprotected shallow wells, which is 85% of the total shallow wells in Berdale, have been submerged by the floodwater. The IDPs and Host communities in the district depends on boreholes and shallow wells as their main source of water which is critical to survive after it has been submerged by the flash floods. The price of one drum of water (200ltr) is 20,000 Somali shilling which is approximately 1 USD therefore, 95% of the Berdale residents have no access to safe water supply due to the pool stagnant water and submerged of all other shallow wells by the floods.\n\nINTERSOS is the focal point for Berdale flood response in collaboration with all partners and cluster leads for distribution of hygiene kits, NFIs and medical supplies mobilized and channeled into INTERSOS. In this regards, INTERSOS will ensure to adhere and coordinate with other partners for identification of vulnerable communities and avoiding overlapping of responses and mitigating to improve the coordination system among partners on ground. \n  \n\nThe   objective of the response is to provide lifesaving emergency WASH assistance to 6500 HH from the  most vulnerable population affected by the floods in Berdale district to improve the access of clean and safe water through provision of water tracking, hygiene promotion and shallow wells rehabilitations. The proposed response aims to increase the access of clean safe water to the community and decreases the acute watery diarrhea/cholera outbreaks and waterborne diseases, which is one of the priorities in the HRP strategy of INTERSOS and in line with the SHF reserve allocation of 2019 for the flood response. The project will enable INTERSOS to convert proposed immediate needs outlined by the Inter-agency report into immediate interventions to respond the floods affected communities in Berdale.  \n\nINTERSOS will address the sanitation and hygiene practices among the target beneficiaries through hygiene promotion, distribution of hygiene kits and provision of water purified tablets and water treatment of all water sources through training of water management committees, community volunteers and hygiene promoters with water treatment and chlorination. The project also targets to improve the knowledge, attitude and practices of the community for sanitation and hygiene practices at community and household level to ensure access in water quality and enhancing the level of understanding to the community in public ownership for regular monitoring and supervision. \nThroughout this proposed lifesaving assistance, INTERSOS will provide WASH packages and services to approximately 25,000 beneficiaries (host community and IDPs) of which 8,937 are women and 7,313 men. 4,812 out of the targeted proposed beneficiaries are girls and 3,938 will be boys  . \n\n30 community volunteers will be trained",

Also this project is working to rehabilitate WASH facilities damaged by the floods including repair, disinfection and protection against further flooding. It will contribute to the reduction of emergency WASH gaps reported and works to improve the hygiene practices of the affected communities through kit distribution and awareness campaigns. \nThe project is for 6 months targeting a total beneficiary of 30,000 individuals living in Baldweyn. This reserve allocation will enable QC to scale up flood responses in Beledweyn and reach more beneficiaries in the coming months. \n1.\tThis Project will work to provide emergency water trucking through voucher to flood affected communities in Beledweyn. Currently, potential high-risk areas for the water trucking activities are areas where people are displaced to. A total of 2,500 households equivalent to 15,000 people will be supported  with water voucher for 3 months and each person will be provided 15 l/p/d (acceptable WASH cluster standards in Somalia), with total of 2,520 trucks.\nQC will also provide water to health/nutrition facilities and schools within the target communities. QC will competitively contract water vendors to supply households with agreed quantities over the specified period. Households provided with vouchers will access their allocation of water at the water distribution point on a daily basis. The community water monitors will register the collection of the water in a register book with the household representative and signing or thumb print as a record. All the supplied water will be chlorinated. In addition, a list of recommended boreholes will be mapped out for water trucking. This list will also be shared with suppliers before contracting them.\n2.\tIn addition to the access for drinking water, the proposed project will ensure to improve hygiene practices among the flood-affected people through hygiene kit distribution from WASH supply hub and hygiene promotion awareness. 60 community hygiene promotes will be trained and supported to conduct hygiene awareness and best hygiene practices. This will reduce the risk of AWD/cholera outbreak and improves the sanitation of the targeted Households.\n3.\tAs part of community sanitation improvement and protection against water borne diseases, the proposed project will replace and construct 220 flood resistant latrines through owner driven approach in which QC providers construction materials through voucher system in addition to the labor incentives as cash transfer. Also rehabilitation of 40 institutional latrines in damaged health facilities, schools and public institutions. In addition to this, project will work to repair and disinfect 30 damaged water sources (Shallow wells) and protect them against further flooding. \n\nWith the funds from SHF, QC will work closely with state level and local level authorities, local elders, community members and floods affected population to undertake and determine the project beneficiaries. During the beneficiary identification process QC will consider child-headed households, households headed by disabled persons or elderly persons without support Households with children under 5 poor female-headed households poor households with children admitted in nutrition programs, poor pregnant and lactating women. Public verification will be made which will surely encourage accountability, transparency and fair selection. The project will extend feedback and compliant mechanism already in place where beneficiaries can be able to present their concerns for assistance. A monitoring and evaluation system will also be extended to this project to ensure that project progresses are in line with the objective and intended WASH outcomes.",

The WASH intervention will improve the health and reduce the risk of disease outbreaks in flood-affected communities through increased access to safe water, use of latrines, hygiene promotion and increased adoption of safe hygiene practices. Cash programming, in the form of conditional transfers, vouchers, and cash for work (CfW), will form a core pillar of the proposed intervention. Specifically, the project will provide emergency and flood-resistant sanitation services, rehabilitate water systems, including repair, disinfection, and reinforcement against further flooding, and promote improved hygiene practices. Relief International (RI) will prioritize the rehabilitation and reinforcement of damaged water and sanitation infrastructure to withstand future floods. In the rehabilitation of latrines at household, communal and institutional levels, RI will adopt flood-resistant design and construction methods. Specifically, RI will train masons on flood- resistant latrine construction techniques, procure construction materials, and incentivize the rehabilitation of targeted latrines through vouchers. RI will assess the damage and strategically rehabilitate, reinforce for flood resistance, and disinfect strategic water points. Newly flood-displaced people will have increased access to safe water from RI contracted water trucking companies. To minimize overlap, RI will continue to liaise with Qatar Charity and Save the Children on water trucking targeting. Through the regional WASH cluster and the government-led floods taskforce, RI will coordinate with government, UN agencies, and NGO partners on the response. RI will solicit feedback from community members on their needs and other support they may be receiving from other sources to appropriately target the proposed interventions and minimize overlap and duplication. Through a CfW scheme, able-bodied community members will establish a disposal site to dispose appropriately of debris that has accumulated due to floods. With in-kind hygiene kits distributed to flood-affected households and targeted dissemination of hygiene promotion messages, RI will promote improved hygiene. RI will leverage its health and nutrition data to target hotspots for acute diarrheal disease. This case tracing approach will support the proactive targeting of people in need of hygiene promotion, hygiene kits, safe water, and latrines. Trained hygiene promoters will complement case tracing with routine interaction with community members and door-to-door household hygiene awareness campaigns. RI will target newly flood-displaced people in settlements and after they return. RI will assess the situation at the time of implementation to ensure that newly flood-displaced are primarily targeted. These interventions will improve wellbeing, prevent morbidity, and restore dignity for flood-affected communities in Beletweyne.",

Already at least 6.3 million people, nearly half of the country\u2019s population are affected by the situation. More than 548,000 people in Somalia have been forced to flee their homes due to flooding in the Hiran region (Belet Weyne, Buuloburto and Jalalaqsi) including children (OCHA report Nov.). Belet Weyne town and the surrounding areas of Hiran region of Somalia is the worst affected where more than 140,000 people are already flee from their homes with empty handed and displaced highland locations, while some households displaced to their relatives living non flood affected areas, putting burden to already vulnerable communities with limited resources (food and water). Authorities and the local community members are trying to mitigate the impact of the floods in residential areas. However, flood risks are still high considering the flow of water to downstream areas of River Shabelle as water levels in Belet Weyne are receding. In this proposal, AADSOM will improve access to safe water, sanitation facilities and promote good hygiene practices to reduce the negative impacts of the flood in Jalalaqsi district. Under this allocation, AADSOM will improve better access to clean water, use of latrines and increased health promotion and safe hygiene practices to 20,000 women, men, boys and girls including people with disabilities and marginalized communities affected by the current floods. Key activities AADSOM would like to undertake within this project include:\n- Provision of safe water to 1000 households representing 6,000 men, women and children affected population through water vendors (water trucking) by using Water Voucher (WV) \n- Upgrade/Rehabilitation of one strategic borehole equipped with hybrid system and rehabilitation of flood damaged 20 shallow wells with hand pumps. \n- Capacity building of 11 WASH committees and 42 Well Operators to ensure continuity of service, operation and maintenance, coupled training on DDR and conflict resolution mechanisms as cross cutting\n- Construction flood destructed 214 gender separated and flood proof latrines and 6 gender sensitive flood proof institutional latrines in Nasrudin Primary School with lockable doors to avoid GBV against women and girls and washing basin benefiting around 245 students.\n- Conducting comprehensive hygiene promotion campaigns to reach 20,000 men, women, boys and girls through visiting house to house, schools, health centers and feeding centers \n-Training 15 community hygiene promoters, who will carry out hygiene promotion activities during and after the project is faced out and \n-Distribution of 1000 HP kits to 1000 households (UNICEF will supply) with vulnerable populations served by the established water services. \nThe proposed response took into consideration the impact of women, and children in terms of access to WASH services.

The nutrition cluster priority districts in Hiran region including Beletweyne due to critical levels of GAM rate at 19.6 and SAM of 4.1. The project is designed in such a way that while providing emergency lifesaving interventions it will also provide longer term sustainable solutions for affected populations. To ensure the emergency interventions are linked to durable solutions, the project includes construction, rehabilitation and upgrading of water supply systems and promotion of hygiene and sanitation services.\n\nThe project will contribute to improving equitable access to quality life-saving curative and preventative health, nutrition and WASH services through the support of static health facilities and mobile outreach to the flood affected populations in Hiran, particularly Beletweyne District. There will be 8 sites that will provide integrated health and nutrition services for flood affected communities, offering outpatient consultations, routine immunization, maternal healthcare, disease surveillance and health promotion as well as systematic identi\ufb01cation, referral and treatment of acutely malnourished cases by providing integrated nutrition services to OTPs, TSFP, IYCF-E and referral to stabilization centers. Micronutrient supplementation, promotion of IYCF practices, promoting the adoption of good hygiene and sanitation practices will also be provided. Special focus will be given to prevention of disease outbreak and malnutrition, improve early identification malnutrition by empowering mothers to use MUAC screening, access to primary health care, and therefore reduce excess morbidity and mortality. \n\nThe WASH component in health and nutrition will also improve good hygiene practices, rehabilitation of WASH infrastructure, more equitable and better access to sustainable water points for drinking and handwashing with soap, and provision of basic sanitation services in these facilities. Hygiene and sanitation support and promotion will be provided in an integrated approach in the health and nutrition sites. There will also be outreach nutrition, hygiene and health promotion within the community and in schools. This will empower children to be agents of change for hygiene promotion.",

Since inception, the Somalia NGO Consortium has grown as an effective network, actively supporting its members to promote dialogue, collaboration, learning experiences, information exchange and to advocate on issues of key concern. Currently, the Consortium is the primary NGO coordination and representation mechanism, with a membership of 93 national and international NGOs working in all parts of Somalia/Somaliland, around humanitarian, development, peace-building, health, education among other thematic areas.  Governed by a Steering Committee elected by the membership, the SNC provides a platform for information-sharing and representation to governments, UN agencies, donor groups and multilateral organisations at local, national and international levels. The Consortium has offices and representation in Mogadishu, Hargeisa, Garowe, Baidoa, Kismayo and plans to expand its reach to constituencies in the remaining federal states through extensive outreach work from the current offices. The SNC expects to reach 100 NGOs by end of 2019 which will increase membership needs. The SNC is currently co-funded through Swiss Development Cooperation (SDC), Somalia Humanitarian Fund (SHF), OFDA (USAID), Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA) and membership subscription fees. Legal and contractual responsibilities associated with funding and contracting are held by host agencies, as SNC is not a legally constituted entity, but rather a network of its membership. During the relocation process in 2019, the SNC has gone through transitions on multiple levels including management and relocation form Nairobi to Mogadishu. Our costs and needs from our membership have significantly increased and significant positions are left unfilled including Advocacy Officer, Deputy Director and Grants amp Partnership Officer.

This safety platform is managed since April 2015 by INSO.\n\nIn response to and following the guidance of an Advisory Board (which is composed by 4 INGOs and 1 LNGOs), the project focuses on two main pillars of action which can be summarized as Information, Analysis and Advice, and Preparedness and Response. The two pillars are strongly interconnected: NGOs need accurate and timely security information to base their decisions on, while they need the proper safety training to organize and take relevant security decisions. Finally, in case an incident takes place, NGOs receive adequate support.\n\nThrough INSO\u2019s own network of Deputy Safety Advisors and Safety Advisor Assistants, NGO reports, collaboration with other security actors and media follow up, INSO collects, verifies, compiles and analyses security incidents. Besides, since 2010, the project has developed a database of more than 41,000 incidents that constitutes a unique tool for data analysis. The INSO field teams help NGOs on the ground to deal with daily security incidents, such as arrests, accidents and threats, while the INSO senior management team can provide support to critical incidents such as kidnappings, abductions, injuries and medical evacuations. The extent of INSO involvement is determined by the NGO who requests our services.\n\nDue to the peculiar mandate and mission of INSO, its Hargeisa office has a dual role, both as coordination hub and implementer of core INSO activities (such as roundtables, individual briefings, and production of maps and reports). Likewise, senior management (including the Country Director) are highly involved in the direct delivery of our services: they are not just managers but also direct implementers in their role as advisors to other NGOs. \n\nThe project budget leans heavily on HR costs because the project\u2019s core product is knowledge. That\u2019s in essence what INSO\u2019s beneficiaries receive. When the main output of an organization is information, the organization core cost is HR \u2013 same as e.g. an online newspaper or a management consulting firm.",

The project addresses urgent needs for water and sanitation provision in rural and peri-urban areas affected by recurring droughts and waterborne diseases such as acute watery diarrhea and cholera. Indeed, the state of disrepair of water and sanitation infrastructure is a major factor contributing to significant outbreaks of water-borne diseases, particularly diarrhea whose incidence rate in Somalia is 21%. The interventions proposed under this project will therefore improve the quality of life of about 175,000 people and their livestock in rural Somalia. They are articulated around the following two operational components: 1) capacity building and 2) construction / rehabilitation of water supply and sanitation infrastructure for stability and resilience that will create about 1,300 jobs. In addition, the project will promote the use of water for multiple purposes, community mobilization campaigns and awareness of health and hygiene issues will be conducted, practices of nond\u00e9f\u00e9cation in the open, through the community-led total sanitation approach will also be promoted. The total cost of the project is estimated at about UA 8,189 million.",

The  project  focuses  on increasing access to safe water, improved sanitation and strengthening capacity for improved delivery of water and sanitation services in Kismayo (Jubbaland State) and Baidoa (South West State) towns. The project will reduce  economic  and  social  exclusion  of  poor  and  vulnerable  groups in the  two  towns,  where an estimated 65% of the population live below the basic needs poverty line and 70% of the population is younger than 30 years is often unemployed by improving access to safe and reliable water supply. The project will improve access to affordable water supply and sanitation services in Kismayo and  Baidoa,  particularly for  the  Internally  Displaced  Persons  (IDP\u2019s) -who  comprise  43%  of  the population, have contributed significantly to the growing urban informality in the two towns, and are facing great hardship in accessing clean water and improved sanitation. Water and Sanitation tariffs will be reviewed to incorporate lifeline tariffs, which often ensure that those in greatest hardship can afford water  and  sanitation  services.  Selected  education,  health and  market facilities  will  also  benefit  from improved water and sanitation facilities and  hygiene training and promotion.  The  project  will  cost an estimated  UA 9.589 million  and its implementation period is 48 months with a completion date of September 2023.",

It consists of two broad components namely: (i) strengthening domestic revenue mobilization and public financial management; and (ii) advancing financial sector development. The operation has been designed in anticipation of Somalia\u2019s arrears clearance, a process being undertaken by the United Kingdom (UK). It takes into account the need for the Bank to step up its re-engagement with Somalia, post-arrears clearance, and to support the country\u2019s on-going economic and financial reforms. The implementation of the reforms being supported by the program is expected to lead to high, sustainable and inclusive growth for Somalia.

        "description": "This project seeks to enhance the living conditions and access to service for estimated 9,000 IDP households (54,000 persons) in Kaxda and Daynile districts of Benadir. This will be achieved through a number of interrelated and complementary activities including setting up and strengthening of camp governance structures where necessary to enhance information-sharing and foster system-wide coordination among service providers. Key program activities also include construction of temporary, multi-purpose social halls to provide space for improved coordination and effective management of sites. Periodic service mapping and site monitoring will be undertaken in close coordination with the CCCM cluster and other partners to effectively address existing gaps and maximize efficiency of the humanitarian response. \n\nAn integral part of the proposed intervention is to support community led site maintenance activities through cash for work schemes to ensure upkeep of sites. During the course of project duration, AVORD will also distribute a range of tools for effective disaster and solid waste management. Critical site infrastructure including 240 latrines and 40 main gates will be upgraded to minimize protection risks and enhance safety at sites. In the selection of beneficiaries for cash-for-work activities, AVORD will adapt a systematic approach with a clear criterion to prioritize the most vulnerable households including the marginalized, single headed-households, large families and/or families with children under the age of 5, women at risk as identified by protection officers and those with special needs. Data collected to inform beneficiary selection will be segregated by gender to ensure that no group is left-out. List of beneficiaries along with their contact numbers will be availed to SHF and other actors responding in the area to avoid overlap. \n\nThe effectiveness of the aid package will be evaluated through monitoring of activities thus ensuring that beneficiaries access their services safely and in a dignified manner. Protection will be mainstreamed throughout project duration by closely coordinating with other partners operating Sexual and Gender Based Violence (SGBV) crisis centers and facilitating principled referrals where necessary. An elaborate feedback and complain mechanism will be setup to ensure accountability to the affected population.",

        "description": "The education system has suffered widespread loss and damage, resulting in limited capacity and resources.\nAccess to education has reached a historic low, with more than three million children today out of schools in Somalia. The national Gross Enrollment Rate (GER) is 30 per cent for primary education and 26 per cent for secondary level education (HRP 2019 report). \nThe project intends to target 16 IDP sites in Baidoa town. The identified camps are among the 391 IDP camps which were in great majority set up during 2017 and which are home to 47,873 HHs (CCCM report, DSA, March 2019). \nThis project aims to achieve access to education for IDP children by targeting 2,185 out of school children (1,090 boys and 1,095 girls) living inside IDP settlements in Baidoa to ensure their access to school thus enhancing their safety and protection as well as the enjoyment of their rights. Out of the total 2,185 children, 2,060 are primary school age children while 125 are secondary school age children and/or children above 15 years.\nThis project will ensure that emergency and crisis affected children/youth have access to safe and protective learning environments in the partner schools. This will be done through a comprehensive action to respond to immediate and longer term needs of the children. The learners will be provided with access to food, water and scholastic material and children with protection concerns will be supported through strengthening/creating referral mechanisms where necessary, to specialized services. Girl  education will be at the center of the project encompassing all activities and it will be promoted with trainings, advocacy campaigns and community mobilization in support of changing negative attitudes and practices. Adolescent school aged girls will also be provided with sanitary pads in support to improving their attendance rates in classrooms and CECs will be sensitized on the importance of girls\u2019 education during the back to school campaigns. Personal hygiene and sanitation, school personnel and parents\u2019 commitment to provide leadership in promoting girls\u2019 education are proven to be two key factors in improving girls\u2019 attendance rates as recommended by the beneficiaries during FGDs held by INTERSOS staff in the current SHF EiE project implemented din Wajid and Education Cannot Wait project implemented last year in Baidoa. \nThe foreseen construction and rehabilitation of temporary learning spaces will ensure access to a safe and enabling learning environment. Additionally, capacity building will be conducted for CECs and teachers on pedagogy, child protection, child wellbeing and psychosocial support. Teachers will also be supported through payment of monthly incentives corresponding to 100 USD for a period of 8 months. \nAmong the 16 targeted settlements, the 3 IDP camps located within the Horseed urban village called Shimo Tiyeglow, Kalimey and Bohaladi will be provided with two new learning spaces and segregated gender latrines since no education service is present in this area. \nChild protection is mainstreamed into the project. One of the key focus of the project will be indeed to prevent and respond to children with protection concern considering the school as a safe space and an entry point to enhance children\u2019s protective environment. The project will conduct regular analysis of the situation of children regarding causes and patterns of protection concerns and will respond accordingly through prevention and strengthening or creating quick referral pathways, conduct service mapping to facilitate appropriate referrals and strengthen coordination and linkages in service delivery to ensure quality comprehensive services to the children with protection concerns.\n Building communities\u2019 resilience and promoting the reintegration of children in the formal education system. In 2018 INTERSOS already successfully referred and supported 117 children to the public schools Mustafa Sheik and Sahal Moalim.",

The project will be implemented in IDP camps of Galkacayo where thousands of emergencies affected children are denied of their right to basic education due to lack of support and school facilities in their settlements. In conflicts or crises situation, enrollment rates fall, and drop-out increases and children are denied access to education and therefore remain out-of-school. \n\nThe project will adopt an integrated approach to promoting safe, inclusive and quality learning opportunities for the children affected by crisis and provide essential support for students and schools. The support include the construction and rehabilitation of temporary and permanent learning spaces, distribution of school equipment and learning materials, construction of water storage facilities and gender-segregated latrines provision of drinking water delivery of hygiene promotion services and provision of live-saving services such as provision of school meals. \n\nThe project will also give special emphasis on the protection and the well-being of children by establishing and training community child protection committee at schools, training teachers on psychosocial support as well developing and rolling out of community-based child protection mechanism. Besides, referral centers will be mapped and assessed to refer and assist children who required referral for further support. Child protection focal points will be recruited at schools while all schools will have active child to child clubs. The purpose of these activities are to promote the safety and protection of students at schools, make school safe and child-friendly zone and identify and support children with protection and psychosocial support. This will also cultivate a culture that respects child rights and promotes their protection. \n\nThe ultimate aim of the project is to ensure greater access in safe learning environment and improved learning for children affected by emergencies to reduce violence, avoid further marginalization and loss of another generation. \n\nIn order to improve the quality of education, teachers will be trained on child-centered teaching methods and psycho-social support, and given emergency incentives.  Community Education Committees (CECs), local authorities and partners will be trained on psycho-social support skills, emergency preparedness, contingency planning and related issues. The proposed intervention will also improve the education authorities\u2019 and CECs capacity to plan for and respond to education in emergency situations.\n\nThe project will target and support a total of 6750 students, 120 teachers and 140 CEC members.Beneficiaries will be selected through participatory and predetermined selection criteria prioritizing the most affected and needy people and 48% will be girls. Gender will be mainstreamed into the project through the specific consideration of the different needs of women, men, boys and girls during the design of activities. The project will ensure that all participants have equal access to resources and training. Monitoring and evaluation will be based on gender, age and diversity dis-segregated data. \n\nThe project will be directly implemented by NRC in collaboration with Puntland State ministry of Educations and Education clusters. A comprehensive monitoring framework will be developed for the project and information including attendance, drop out will be collected using Kobo toolbox and analyzed and shared. Success stories will be documented and shared with all stakeholders.",

        "title": "Sustainable Access to clean Water,Hygiene and Sanitation to droughts affected communities in Sanaag and Sool region",
        "description": "Sanaag and Sool regions have been facing both acute and chronic water shortages for many years. The prolonged droughts experienced in 2016/2017 have seriously affected the local communities and the water facilities too. The traditional water facilities, such as shallow wells, water pans, dams frequently dry out and there are very few boreholes-which frequently breakdown due to high demand and overuse. Badhan for instance, has a high population (89,435 people) in Eastern Sanaag, and is an old town with no permanent water sources. During the dry period, people trek more than 100km to the nearest water points, while the water prices unreasonably increase to more than 300% (Adeso internal reports). Qawlo under Taleex has similar water needs as Badhan, with an estimated population of 73,529 (UNPFA 2014 data). These 2 locations (Badhan and Qawlo) are highly populated with large rural and [pastoral population and they frequently face water shortages.  \nAdeso propose to drill and equip strategic boreholes in these 2 main centers with adequate water distribution system. The project will be implemented together with the private sector, community and the government to ensure contributions from all stakeholders, the ownership and foreseeable sustainability. Our strategy is to encourage a participatory process with the key stakeholders being involved, develop local ownership and strengthen governance structure for such response. Adeso will enhance this strategy to enable value for money and high impact for this project.  The community and the private sector will contribute 20% of the total cost of Badhan borehole (that is equivalent to $40,000).\nThe drilling and equipping will be done through a competent local contractor, thoroughly vetted by the community, the government and Adeso technical team. Adeso will hire a water engineer, fully dedicated for this project and ensure the expected standards are met. The same contractor will do the hydro-geological survey, identify the best aquifer, present report for deliberation before moving to the actual drilling.  Adeso has strong experience in Somalia and combining hydro-geological survey and drilling into one contract will ensure smooth operation and that the contractor meets the expectation as per the contract.  Adeso will carry out, through its WASH team, an environmental and social impact analysis that may come as a result of the new borehole and apply the necessary mitigation measures in good time.  The proposed boreholes will have several distribution systems, including different water points for the livestock to avoid water contamination. \nThe project will also construct latrines for the poor households, hygiene and sanitation awareness as well as strengthening the water governance structures. The ministries of water, both from Somaliland side for Talex / Qawlo site and Puntland side for Badhan will be involved to ensure the government support and also the response meet the government vision of providing adequate water to the people. \nA water ground breaking analysis will be done to determine the chemical, mineral and the biological analysis of the water.  This will be done as soon as the ground water is hit before any further work is done. The region has a history of salinity and great care needs to be taken with this, so if one aquifer fails or becomes saline, then the contractor moves to another site until the best water quality is achieved. \nAdeso is currently implementing an OFDA funded WASH project in these regions, that has mainly rehabilitation of the rural water facilities-such as shallow wells, boreholes, water pans with hygiene and sanitation components. A climate change adaption project is also being implemented in building community resilience to shocks / adaptation. Adeso recently concluded a 5 year EU Natural resource management program. These interventions provide strong complementarity to the proposed response that will result in high impact.",

        "description": "The humanitarian situation in Northern Somalia in 2018 remains fragile due to residual impact of drought, Cyclone Sagar, conflict and ongoing displacement. While the risk of famine has reduced, humanitarian needs remain high, with extreme water and pasture shortages reported in rainfall deficit areas of Bari, Nugaal, Sool and Sanaag regions. Water scarcity in Sool and Sanaag regions has reached a precarious level, affecting the health of the most vulnerable people and causing occasional resource-based clan conflicts. With only a third of the population having access to improved sanitation, poor hygiene practices (including frequent open defecation) are prevalent, contributing to incidences of water-borne diseases. Consequently, there is an urgent need to improve WASH service delivery at district level. \n\nIn this context, ACTED will implement a WASH cluster-specific intervention aiming to 1) Provide reliable and sustained access to sufficient safe water, based on identified strategic water points 2) Establish an appropriate system for the management and maintenance of facilities, with different groups contributing equitably and 3) Enhance community sanitation and hygiene awareness. \n\nACTED will implement these activities in Taleex district of Sool region, and Erigavo and Dararweyne districts of Sanaag region, targeting a highly vulnerable and largely undeserved area. Approximately 15,000 people (2,500 households) will benefit from this intervention, in addition to creating synergies for improved coordination among WASH stakeholders in the area, including local authorities, clusters and other NGOs. These numbers might vary due to external factors such as the drought, which might attract more IDPs, or escalation of conflict, which may cause communities to flee to other areas.",

Education specific activities will include the provision of education supplies, emergency take-away food rations for students to meet their food and energy needs and emergency teacher incentives to motivate teachers to stay in the schools. Specific WASH activities will include increasing schools\u2019 water storage capacity through the provision of PVC storage tanks, the construction and rehabilitation of latrines, and improving hygiene practices among children through engagement with school hygiene promoters. As hygiene promoters will interact closely with students during hygiene promotion sessions and recreational activities, CISP will train this cadre on hygiene promotion, psycho-social support (PSS), and child protection and safeguarding. Specific Protection activities will include the mapping and sharing of existing child protection service providers and their respective services to school administrators and communities, strengthening child protection systems in schools, including the recruitment and training of child protection focal persons at each school, and awareness raising and training of community education committees (CEC) on child protection. CISP will also continue to engage with Ministry of Education Culture and Higher Education (MoECHE) and train cluster partners and MoE staffs on safe schools contingency planning, DRR and emergency response. CISP will provide training to CECs on their roles and responsibilities, food and water management, disaster risk reduction (DRR), civic skills, proposal development, and child protection in the respective schools. To ensure water availability in targeted schools, CISP will provide cash grants to CECs. In return, CECs will contribute in-kind or cash to procure safe water and manage its distribution to students. Further, the CECs will be trained on DRR to build their capacity and improve school preparedness against armed attack and other natural disasters. Disability and gender-friendly latrines in the targeted schools will be rehabilitated or, where necessary, constructed to minimize disruptions in learning for girls and boys. CISP will coordinate enrollment drives through MoE and with CECs and religious leaders to encourage school enrollment with an emphasis on children affected by displacement. CISP education department will utilize the existing synergies with CISP protection department to assess the existing child protection mechanisms at the start of the project, and, as determined from the assessment results, targeted schools will develop appropriate action plans to address areas of concern. To measure the effectiveness of the child protections systems implemented and capture lessons learned, CISP will conduct an end line assessment. Through the CISP protection department engagement with CEC\u2019s and the regional Gender Focal Points (GFP\u2019s) of MoE, CISP will leverage the agency's apparatus and community assets to raise awareness among children on child protection and the established mechanisms which will serve to strengthen child protection in schools.",

                "In 2004 Oxfam Novib set up a Liaison Office in Nairobi, Kenya in order to support the Strengthening Somali Civil Society Program, at the request of the EU. This request was based on Oxfam Novib's work in Somalia to date, but intended to be more widely directed atthe entire civil society sector and the specific context in which it is operating in a post-conflict country. The program started with consulting local organisations in Somalia and Somaliland to get a complete picture of the sectors and regions where they are active, the challenges they face and the relationship between civil society, local political structures and the private sector. A program was then developed to strengthen the institutional development of Oxfam Novib's partners and those of other Oxfams, as well as a range of new NGOs.\nIn the first year local consultants were trained in Somalia. They were then seconded to civil society organisations to build their capacity in financial and organisational management. Furthermore, workshops were organised on specific themes suchas human rights and the role of civil society in the Somali context. The Liaison Office is now going to support the expansion of the program, focussing on strengthening both organisation and project management, while facilitating more training in the fields of civic education, governance, human rights and women's rights, HIV and AIDS and child protection.\nOver the years, the Somalia Country Office has expanded its intervention on short term humanitarian response as well as development development interventions. In 2015/2016, a decision was reached to move the Country Programme operation, which was largely in Nairobi, from Nairobi to Hargeisa. The country office has a small office in Nairobi , Kenya and large operations office in Hargeisa, Somaliland."

The Somalia Joint Response 2020 is a continuation of the response in 2019, and will focus on the following sectors: FSL, Protection, WASH, Health and Nutrition. A special focus will be on localisation and supporting LNGOs in capacity strengthening and becoming the lead of future responses.

This model will be peer-reviewed by other experts in the Global South. Once further funding is secured, it will become operational, with multiple organizations making varied, layered contributions to common outcomes according to their strengths # to ensure humanitarian responses uphold interwoven development and peace objectives and are thereby sustainable and transformative.\nAdditionally, the platform willproduce a robust operating procedure for its Anticipatory Response Fund, which serves as an emergency response mechanism/crisis modifier. Many INGOs, including Oxfam in Myanmar and Bangladesh, have successfully piloted this response mechanism with local partners.Upon request by local partners, the Somalia Joint Response is also piloting this mechanism with local partners in 2020, and all SOMJR INGOs have included a crisis modifier in their budgets in 2020. The Anticipatory Response Fund serves as a means for local humanitarian partners to quickly access funding to respond to sudden crises and emergencies. The fund's aim is to address funding gaps andensure quick access to emergency funding for local responders. The fund will build oncurrent initiatives in country to promote local humanitarian leadership and preparedness, and deliver on commitments made in the Grand Bargain and Charter for Change by donor andNGO signatories. It will also identify strengths and areas for capacity development in relation to emergency response in Somalia The operating procedure for the Anticipatory Response Fund will include triggers and related protocols, such that a pilot test of triggers, collaboration mechanisms and protocols can take place ahead ofthe humanitarian response windows, in the second half of 2020.\nBeyond the pilot phase, these actions will lay the foundations for a response mechanism that is pre-emptive and therefore efficient and highly responsive # improving the quality of locally-led humanitarian response in Somalia and Somaliland. Delivering on the ambition statement (i.e. development of above-mentioned model for humanitarian programming and operating procedures) will contribute to all four DRA strategic priorities: 1) more effective support for locally-led responses by supporting Nexus as locally-led platform; 2) innovation and learning by generating knowledge outputs and new ways of working; 3) collaboration for increased effectiveness by bringing together a wide range of localactors with coverage of all 9 regions of Somalia and Somaliland; and 4) more accountable humanitarian action by giving voice and decision making power to local organisations and adding rigor through South-South peer review.",

                "In 2004 Oxfam Novib set up a Liaison Office in Nairobi, Kenya in order to support the Strengthening Somali Civil Society Program, at the request of the EU. This request was based on Oxfam Novib's work in Somalia to date, but intended to be more widely directed atthe entire civil society sector and the specific context in which it is operating in a post-conflict country. The program started with consulting local organisations in Somalia and Somaliland to get a complete picture of the sectors and regions where they are active, the challenges they face and the relationship between civil society, local political structures and the private sector. A program was then developed to strengthen the institutional development of Oxfam Novib's partners and those of other Oxfams, as well as a range of new NGOs.\nIn the first year local consultants were trained in Somalia. They were then seconded to civil society organisations to build their capacity in financial and organisational management. Furthermore, workshops were organised on specific themes suchas human rights and the role of civil society in the Somali context. The Liaison Office is now going to support the expansion of the program, focussing on strengthening both organisation and project management, while facilitating more training in the fields of civic education, governance, human rights and women's rights, HIV and AIDS and child protection.\nOver the years, the Somalia Country Office has expanded its intervention on short term humanitarian response as well as development development interventions. In 2015/2016, a decision was reached to move the Country Programme operation, which was largely in Nairobi, from Nairobi to Hargeisa. The country office has a small office in Nairobi , Kenya and large operations office in Hargeisa, Somaliland."

        "description": "Core Humanitarian Standard, evidence-based and that meets needs holistically by integrating a triple nexus approach. This model will be peer-reviewed by other experts in the Global South. Once further funding is secured, it will become operational, with multiple organizations making varied, layered contributions to common outcomes according to their strengths # to ensure humanitarian responses uphold interwoven development and peace objectives and are thereby sustainable and transformative.\nAdditionally, the platform willproduce a robust operating procedure for its Anticipatory Response Fund, which serves as an emergency response mechanism/crisis modifier. Many INGOs, including Oxfam in Myanmar and Bangladesh, have successfully piloted this response mechanism with local partners.Upon request by local partners, the Somalia Joint Response is also piloting this mechanism with local partners in 2020, and all SOMJR INGOs have included a crisis modifier in their budgets in 2020. The Anticipatory Response Fund serves as a means for local humanitarian partners to quickly access funding to respond to sudden crises and emergencies. The fund's aim is to address funding gaps andensure quick access to emergency funding for local responders. The fund will build oncurrent initiatives in country to promote local humanitarian leadership and preparedness, and deliver on commitments made in the Grand Bargain and Charter for Change by donor andNGO signatories. It will also identify strengths and areas for capacity development in relation to emergency response in Somalia The operating procedure for the Anticipatory Response Fund will include triggers and related protocols, such that a pilot test of triggers, collaboration mechanisms and protocols can take place ahead ofthe humanitarian response windows, in the second half of 2020.\nBeyond the pilot phase, these actions will lay the foundations for a response mechanism that is pre-emptive and therefore efficient and highly responsive # improving the quality of locally-led humanitarian response in Somalia and Somaliland. Delivering on the ambition statement (i.e. development of above-mentioned model for humanitarian programming and operating procedures) will contribute to all four DRA strategic priorities: 1) more effective support for locally-led responses by supporting Nexus as locally-led platform; 2) innovation and learning by generating knowledge outputs and new ways of working; 3) collaboration for increased effectiveness by bringing together a wide range of localactors with coverage of all 9 regions of Somalia and Somaliland; and 4) more accountable humanitarian action by giving voice and decision making power to local organisations and adding rigor through South-South peer review.",

Toll-free Covid-19 helplines our partner Shaqodoon is running in the Ministries of Health in Somaliland and Puntland have been launched in mid-April and beginnning of May respectively. The call centres utilize an interactive voice response system providing up to date information related to Covid-19 to the community. People can call the hotline and receive WHO-approved pre-recorded messages on COVID-19, check symptoms, and also talk to a healthofficers if they wish to doso. They can also leave a voicemail and will be called back. The system can be accessed free of charge through mobile phones for callers using a 3-digit shortcode.\nThe Somaliland hotline has registered more than 651,366 callsso far (as of 19 May), highlighting the thirst of people across Somaliland for accurate and reliable information on Covid-19.  A number of risk cases have been identifiedthrough the helplines already, and people tested as a result of their call and guidance received. Shaqodoon is highlighting common misinformation on Covid-19 gathered through calls as well as stats on calls, follow-up and regional origin of callers on dashboards which support the Ministry of Health and humanitarian partners in addressing needs in a timely manner. They also produce weekly dashboards to provide the Ministry of Health with an overview of calls, levels of (mis-)information per region and necessary follow-up.\n\nThis project would support Shaqodoon in extending the helpline service in collaboration with the Ministries of Health for another 2months until June/July, reaching a majority of the population in Puntland and Somaliland (at least 60% of the population) with accurate and timely information, guidance and symptoms checking, while at the same time ensuring call center staff and Ministry of Health officials receive adequate protection and safe programming support to deal with sensitive data and critical cases.  Their work will be accompanied by the installment of innovative hands-free handwashing stations designed and produced in the TVET centres of partner Havoyoco. These measures will reach another 30,000 people across Somaliland.",

                "In 2004 Oxfam Novib set up a Liaison Office in Nairobi, Kenya in order to support the Strengthening Somali Civil Society Program, at the request of the EU. This request was based on Oxfam Novib's work in Somalia to date, but intended to be more widely directed atthe entire civil society sector and the specific context in which it is operating in a post-conflict country. The program started with consulting local organisations in Somalia and Somaliland to get a complete picture of the sectors and regions where they are active, the challenges they face and the relationship between civil society, local political structures and the private sector. A program was then developed to strengthen the institutional development of Oxfam Novib's partners and those of other Oxfams, as well as a range of new NGOs.\nIn the first year local consultants were trained in Somalia. They were then seconded to civil society organisations to build their capacity in financial and organisational management. Furthermore, workshops were organised on specific themes suchas human rights and the role of civil society in the Somali context. The Liaison Office is now going to support the expansion of the program, focussing on strengthening both organisation and project management, while facilitating more training in the fields of civic education, governance, human rights and women's rights, HIV and AIDS and child protection.\nOver the years, the Somalia Country Office has expanded its intervention on short term humanitarian response as well as development development interventions. In 2015/2016, a decision was reached to move the Country Programme operation, which was largely in Nairobi, from Nairobi to Hargeisa. The country office has a small office in Nairobi , Kenya and large operations office in Hargeisa, Somaliland."

This has proved successful in the last three years. The strategy engages young women and men from diverse backgrounds to be a driving force for social progress and optimism about the future in their respective countries and across Africa.\nWhen we worked with stakeholders in each country to analyse the current situation faced by young men and women, we found three common key needs:\n1. Improving curricula and training methods, creating new modules and connecting the curricula to the demands of the market.\n2. Innovation to respond to social issues such as climate change, gender rights and urbanization.\n3. Linking service delivery interventions with influencing interventions # young people do not need only better training and new skills, but also changes to the system: policies, laws, practices and the attitudes and beliefs of their fellow citizens, employers and the government.\nThese conclusions have guided this proposal in further developing interventions and adapting activities for each country for 2020-2022. We will highlight new interventions in the following chapters.\nOur strategy is based on systems thinking:trying to understand how different parts of a system interact to effect change, rather than understanding specific components in isolation. Systems thinking can help to develop truly sustainable and transformative change.
