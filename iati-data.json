The project will seek to improve the retention of already enrolled children living in flood-affected areas into the quality and inclusive basic education in a safe and protective learning environment. \n\nThe project will target and support 8,750 children (40% girls) in 20 schools, the most affected schools will be selected in coordination with regional coordinators will receive light rehabilitation and furnishing of desks and chairs, provision of teaching and learning materials to 8,750 learners from 20 schools, provision of dignity kits to 2000 adolescent girls to enhance their daily school attendance, provision of recreational materials to 20 schools that are tailored to the needs of children, Provision of community-based psychosocial support in schools, the establishment of 20 temporary child-friendly spaces (CFS) that will support the provision of PSS, recreational activities and non-formal education activities. On the protection front, the project will identify specific protection needs, inform service provision and serve as an entry point for specialized service provision with boys and girls. Targeted psychosocial support, psychological first aid, case management, and emergency referrals will be provided to child survivors of rights violations, Unaccompanied and Separated Children (UASC), and children who show signs of trauma. 500 children will be targeted for IDTR and PSS provided, of which 30% expected to be reunified with their families. \n\nThe proposed intervention will create synergies with existing programs focusing on child protection. The caseworkers and monitors in the present proposal will act as a reference for the referral pathways aiming at connecting services in the communities. Before starting the implementation, HIWA will coordinate with Shelter, protection, WASH, and CCCM to ensure complementarity and reinforcement of the project approach. HIWA has a strong experience in child protection in emergency and in resilience context and has previously implemented child protection programs funded by UNICEF in Beletweyne and Buula Burte, through this experience HIWA has established linkages with community leaders, local authorities and camp leaders making access and acceptance easier in the target locations. HIWA will coordinate with the regional education cluster during the implementation of the project. Coordination with WASH cluster will be essential in implementing the project, HIWA will work closely with Wash partner who will carry out hygiene promotion in schools and also ensure the water sources in the schools are safe.\n\nOpportunities for cross-sectoral collaboration within and beyond the HIWA education and protection sectors will be sought. The collaboration will include emergency operations with cluster partners to ensure a comprehensive approach and view of education and child protection. HIWA will use the strength of its relationship with the regional education and protection clusters to share information and collaborate in service provision to avoid duplication of activities in the selected schools. Before implementation starts, HIWA will liaise with the regional coordination structure to identify schools that have not been targeted by other partners. HIWA will also closely work with Relief International and Qatar foundation on hygiene promotion and other WASH interventions. Referrals will be directed to them where WASH needs are identified in different schools.",

Baidoa and Bardale are the worst affected. It is with this in mind that WRRS has proposed to respond with this life critical intervention.\n\nIn close coordination with the agencies working in Baidoa and Bardale district  WRRS will ensure to provide emergency shelter materials and NFIs particularly in Baidoa district and Bardale  area  to respond to the emergency needs of the newly displaced and  flood affected populations across the two areas. The project will target the most vulnerable IDPs in IDP settlements across the two locations that is Baidoa, and Bardale location. The target will include both new and affected IDPs. The project will target only IDPs the newly displaced and the old IDPs affected by flooding. The project will comprise of two components, Procurement and distribution of Emergency shelter materials that will contain: Local available stick for vertical Post ( Philipian Tree), Local available sticks for truss, door and windows (Philipian Tree) OR White wood(8cm x 4cm size each), Local available sticks (Philipian Tree) for horizontal frames amp roofing OR white wood (5cm x 2.5 cm size each) , Local available sticks (Philipian Tree) at the base of roof truss OR White wood(10cm x 2.5cm size each) among other materials, shelter cluster standard NFI Kits that contains plastic sheet, blanket, sleeping mat, kitchen set, mosquito net, solar lamb and jerry can among others. This will be in order to address the time critical needs for the newly flood displaced population.\n\nThe project main objective is to provide 8772 people (1439 women, 1437 men, 2947 boys and 2949 girls) who have been affected by flooding in Baidoa and Bardale locations. The project is in line with the shelter cluster strategy and objectives. The project will ensure all the target beneficiaries have access to ESKs and NFIs t distributions, PDM will also be conducted to the locations of distribution\n\nWRRS will carry out a rapid market survey to ascertain the availability of ESKs and appropriate NFis in the local market as well as market functionality.Due to the current emergency and the growing need of the materials WRRS will conduct a direct distribution to safe on time and prevent further vulnerability of the affected populations. \nThis will ensure a complementary approach to the provision of services for vulnerable people in Bardale location and Baidoa District. WRRS will mainstream protection monitoring in the project implementation by ensuring that the proposed locations for distribution are carefully considered in terms of the threat of physical attacks, threats to safety such as mines, or environmentally unsuitable areas such as areas prone to flooding. WRRS will coordinate with relevant government authorities, regional cluster leads and other partners working in the area with a view of strengthening local institutions to ensure proper coordination and implementation of the planned activities.",

        "description": "Increased rainfall since the beginning of September in both Ethiopian highlands and within the catchments in Somalia has resulted in a sharp rise in the Shabelle and Juba rivers, leading to severe flooding in southern and central Somalia. According to UNHCR-Protection Return Monitoring Network (PRMN), the recent Shabelle river flooding displaced over 270,000 people, of whom 230,000 are in Beletweyne District. Farmland, infrastructure and roads have been destroyed, and livelihoods disrupted in some of the worst-hit areas. According to the FAO-led Somalia Water and Land Information Management (SWALIM), the rains are projected to continue in the coming weeks and it is expected to end in early December. DRC proposes to undertake a life-saving and sustainable assistance to Flood- Displaced people in Beletweyne through provision of emergency shelter kits (ESK), non-food items (NFIs). DRC will target 2050 households (12,300 people) with ESK and NFIs. The standard emergency NFI package will include plastic sheeting, blankets, sleeping mats, kitchen set, mosquito net, solar lamp and Jerry cans. Where possible, DRC will give the NFIs through cash transfers or vouchers so that beneficiaries can decide based on their needs. DRC will also assist with a standard ESK that contains: Local available stick for vertical post (Philippian Tree) Local available sticks for truss, door and windows (Philippian Tree) or White wood (8cm x 4cm size each) Local available sticks (Philippian Tree) for horizontal frames amp roofing or White wood (5cm x 2.5cm size each) Local available sticks (Philippian Tree) at the base of roof truss or White wood (10cm x 2.5cm size each) Nails No. 5 (5 inch) Nails No. 6 (6 inch) Drum door with frame Hinges for door Local plastic sheet (size: 4m x 7m) and outer wall clothing Buul layer. This provides the most basic shelter which can offer protection from extreme weather. The ESK helps the displaced household to put up by a 4m x 4m shelter structure within the first few days of displacement. DRC is aware that the needs are huge and the available funding cannot cover everyone. DRC is also aware that families of affected persons are normally the first responders and therefore, some families may be better positioned to survive such disaster due to their own social networks. Therefore DRC will develop a selection criteria based on AGD as well as vulnerability to ensure that assistance goes to the ones who deserve it most. Female-headed households, families with many children and the aged (65+ year-olds) will be given priority. DRC will also ensure that, persons living with disabilities (PLDs) or families with such persons are also targeted with assistance.  Families considered extremely vulnerable, will be assisted by DRC to put up their shelter through cash paid after erection. DRC determines that this cash shall be 60 USD and targets 540 hhs out of 2050 hhs. DRC will undertake a post-distribution monitoring (PDM) study four (4) weeks after distribution to measure the effectiveness of distribution and also the satisfaction of the beneficiaries on the items distributed. This will help inform future programming in shelter, NFIs and CCCM programming. Specific to CCCM, DRC shall engage in installation of solar lights and in settlement maintenance including clearance of any solid waste and access roads. DRC will also, jointly with the camp/settlement committees undertake mapping of available services and establish a referral system. Through that, DRC will establish information boards at strategic points like social centers like water points and markets for people to have easy access to information. DRC will support community governance structures through trainings to ensure that camp/settlement committees can manage their daily issues in a structured manner. At sub-national level, DRC will ensure coordination of CCCM meetings happen and deliberations are reported.",

The displaced population is fleeing to high grounds leaving behind household assets completely submerged by water. Safe locations hosting displaced populations lack basic services including safe drinking water and sanitation services. The impact of this is a high incidence of water-borne diseases, growing protection concerns faced by women and girls, conflict activated by sharing of scarce resources and denying the right to access service subjected to people with disabilities, minority groups, and elderly people.\n\nIn this context, PAH will implement a WASH cluster-specific intervention aiming to 1) deliver life-saving WASH assistance to reduce acute need among the vulnerable settlement and communities 2) reduce risk of violence against women, children and vulnerable groups accessing WASH services 3) provide or restore sustainable access to safe water and adequate sanitation services in the targeted communities and institutions.\n\nFloods affected population is farming communities who rely on farming as the main source of livelihood to provide them with income and promote the local economy. PAH has conducted market analysis to assess the capacity of local markets to provide needed WASH items and determine the preference of the affected population. Most interviewed households preferred to be engaged in latrines construction. Based on market capacity and community preference, and building on its previous experience, PAH will construct emergency latrines through cash for work approach selecting skilled individuals from the target population and sourcing construction materials from local vendors pre-identified during the market analysis.\n\n\nTo reduce the negative impact of risky practices and minimize the risk of disease outbreak hygiene kits will be provided to displaced families. The content of the kits will meet cluster standards but will be topped-up with mosquito nets to protect children, pregnant women and elderly persons from malaria. Community-based hygiene promoters will be trained and WASH committees established to promote safe practices.\n\nPAH will implement these activities in the Jowhar district of the Middle Shebelle region. Approximately 13,890 people from 2315 HHs (households) will benefit from this intervention. PAH is one of the main WASH actors fully present in Middle Shebelle implementing emergency and resilience WASH activities in Jowhar and has easy access to crisis-affected locations. PAH is already responding to the flood crisis in Jowhar and is providing lifesaving WASH services including safe water and hygiene kits to 768 displaced people. To address malnutrition PAH is providing 2 months unrestricted cash transfer to 400 most vulnerable families who have lost crops and have malnourished household members. However, the increasing risks and absence of WASH services require immediate scale-up to avert further displacement and disease outbreak. Moreover, PAH will create synergies for improved coordination among WASH stakeholders in the area, including local authorities, clusters, and other NGOs.",

Heavy rains of more than 100mm are expected in Hiraan, Bay and Bakool regions which are already saturated following weeks of continued heavy rains. In South West State, an estimated 70,000 people have been affected and another 40,000 displaced by flash flooding across the region. Berdale town (60 km west of Baidoa) is worst affected. Three quarters of the town is submerged. Local authorities and humanitarian partners estimate that 30,000 people have been affected. The road to Berdale is impassable. Humanitarian partners are working with authorities to scale up the response in the affected areas INTERSOS is targeting to provide emergency WASH response to the floods affected population in Berdale as in line with the needs assessment report conducted by Inter-Agency to quickly identify the vast damages affected by the floods and the priority needs to immediately intervene the humanitarian situation. The report highlighted that around 360 unprotected shallow wells, which is 85% of the total shallow wells in Berdale, have been submerged by the floodwater. The IDPs and Host communities in the district depends on boreholes and shallow wells as their main source of water which is critical to survive after it has been submerged by the flash floods. The price of one drum of water (200ltr) is 20,000 Somali shilling which is approximately 1 USD therefore, 95% of the Berdale residents have no access to safe water supply due to the pool stagnant water and submerged of all other shallow wells by the floods.\n\nINTERSOS is the focal point for Berdale flood response in collaboration with all partners and cluster leads for distribution of hygiene kits, NFIs and medical supplies mobilized and channeled into INTERSOS. In this regards, INTERSOS will ensure to adhere and coordinate with other partners for identification of vulnerable communities and avoiding overlapping of responses and mitigating to improve the coordination system among partners on ground. \n  \n\nThe   objective of the response is to provide lifesaving emergency WASH assistance to 6500 HH from the  most vulnerable population affected by the floods in Berdale district to improve the access of clean and safe water through provision of water tracking, hygiene promotion and shallow wells rehabilitations. The proposed response aims to increase the access of clean safe water to the community and decreases the acute watery diarrhea/cholera outbreaks and waterborne diseases, which is one of the priorities in the HRP strategy of INTERSOS and in line with the SHF reserve allocation of 2019 for the flood response. The project will enable INTERSOS to convert proposed immediate needs outlined by the Inter-agency report into immediate interventions to respond the floods affected communities in Berdale.  \n\nINTERSOS will address the sanitation and hygiene practices among the target beneficiaries through hygiene promotion, distribution of hygiene kits and provision of water purified tablets and water treatment of all water sources through training of water management committees, community volunteers and hygiene promoters with water treatment and chlorination. The project also targets to improve the knowledge, attitude and practices of the community for sanitation and hygiene practices at community and household level to ensure access in water quality and enhancing the level of understanding to the community in public ownership for regular monitoring and supervision. \nThroughout this proposed lifesaving assistance, INTERSOS will provide WASH packages and services to approximately 25,000 beneficiaries (host community and IDPs) of which 8,937 are women and 7,313 men. 4,812 out of the targeted proposed beneficiaries are girls and 3,938 will be boys  . \n\n30 community volunteers will be trained",

Also this project is working to rehabilitate WASH facilities damaged by the floods including repair, disinfection and protection against further flooding. It will contribute to the reduction of emergency WASH gaps reported and works to improve the hygiene practices of the affected communities through kit distribution and awareness campaigns. \nThe project is for 6 months targeting a total beneficiary of 30,000 individuals living in Baldweyn. This reserve allocation will enable QC to scale up flood responses in Beledweyn and reach more beneficiaries in the coming months. \n1.\tThis Project will work to provide emergency water trucking through voucher to flood affected communities in Beledweyn. Currently, potential high-risk areas for the water trucking activities are areas where people are displaced to. A total of 2,500 households equivalent to 15,000 people will be supported  with water voucher for 3 months and each person will be provided 15 l/p/d (acceptable WASH cluster standards in Somalia), with total of 2,520 trucks.\nQC will also provide water to health/nutrition facilities and schools within the target communities. QC will competitively contract water vendors to supply households with agreed quantities over the specified period. Households provided with vouchers will access their allocation of water at the water distribution point on a daily basis. The community water monitors will register the collection of the water in a register book with the household representative and signing or thumb print as a record. All the supplied water will be chlorinated. In addition, a list of recommended boreholes will be mapped out for water trucking. This list will also be shared with suppliers before contracting them.\n2.\tIn addition to the access for drinking water, the proposed project will ensure to improve hygiene practices among the flood-affected people through hygiene kit distribution from WASH supply hub and hygiene promotion awareness. 60 community hygiene promotes will be trained and supported to conduct hygiene awareness and best hygiene practices. This will reduce the risk of AWD/cholera outbreak and improves the sanitation of the targeted Households.\n3.\tAs part of community sanitation improvement and protection against water borne diseases, the proposed project will replace and construct 220 flood resistant latrines through owner driven approach in which QC providers construction materials through voucher system in addition to the labor incentives as cash transfer. Also rehabilitation of 40 institutional latrines in damaged health facilities, schools and public institutions. In addition to this, project will work to repair and disinfect 30 damaged water sources (Shallow wells) and protect them against further flooding. \n\nWith the funds from SHF, QC will work closely with state level and local level authorities, local elders, community members and floods affected population to undertake and determine the project beneficiaries. During the beneficiary identification process QC will consider child-headed households, households headed by disabled persons or elderly persons without support Households with children under 5 poor female-headed households poor households with children admitted in nutrition programs, poor pregnant and lactating women. Public verification will be made which will surely encourage accountability, transparency and fair selection. The project will extend feedback and compliant mechanism already in place where beneficiaries can be able to present their concerns for assistance. A monitoring and evaluation system will also be extended to this project to ensure that project progresses are in line with the objective and intended WASH outcomes.",

        "description": "The proposed six-month project aims to provide urgent lifesaving assistance to flood-affected communities in Beletweyne while mainstreaming protection and integrating sustainable, flood-resistant solutions. The WASH intervention will improve the health and reduce the risk of disease outbreaks in flood-affected communities through increased access to safe water, use of latrines, hygiene promotion and increased adoption of safe hygiene practices. Cash programming, in the form of conditional transfers, vouchers, and cash for work (CfW), will form a core pillar of the proposed intervention. Specifically, the project will provide emergency and flood-resistant sanitation services, rehabilitate water systems, including repair, disinfection, and reinforcement against further flooding, and promote improved hygiene practices. Relief International (RI) will prioritize the rehabilitation and reinforcement of damaged water and sanitation infrastructure to withstand future floods. In the rehabilitation of latrines at household, communal and institutional levels, RI will adopt flood-resistant design and construction methods. Specifically, RI will train masons on flood- resistant latrine construction techniques, procure construction materials, and incentivize the rehabilitation of targeted latrines through vouchers. RI will assess the damage and strategically rehabilitate, reinforce for flood resistance, and disinfect strategic water points. Newly flood-displaced people will have increased access to safe water from RI contracted water trucking companies. To minimize overlap, RI will continue to liaise with Qatar Charity and Save the Children on water trucking targeting. Through the regional WASH cluster and the government-led floods taskforce, RI will coordinate with government, UN agencies, and NGO partners on the response. RI will solicit feedback from community members on their needs and other support they may be receiving from other sources to appropriately target the proposed interventions and minimize overlap and duplication. Through a CfW scheme, able-bodied community members will establish a disposal site to dispose appropriately of debris that has accumulated due to floods. With in-kind hygiene kits distributed to flood-affected households and targeted dissemination of hygiene promotion messages, RI will promote improved hygiene. RI will leverage its health and nutrition data to target hotspots for acute diarrheal disease. This case tracing approach will support the proactive targeting of people in need of hygiene promotion, hygiene kits, safe water, and latrines. Trained hygiene promoters will complement case tracing with routine interaction with community members and door-to-door household hygiene awareness campaigns. RI will target newly flood-displaced people in settlements and after they return. RI will assess the situation at the time of implementation to ensure that newly flood-displaced are primarily targeted. These interventions will improve wellbeing, prevent morbidity, and restore dignity for flood-affected communities in Beletweyne.",

Already at least 6.3 million people, nearly half of the country\u2019s population are affected by the situation. More than 548,000 people in Somalia have been forced to flee their homes due to flooding in the Hiran region (Belet Weyne, Buuloburto and Jalalaqsi) including children (OCHA report Nov.). Belet Weyne town and the surrounding areas of Hiran region of Somalia is the worst affected where more than 140,000 people are already flee from their homes with empty handed and displaced highland locations, while some households displaced to their relatives living non flood affected areas, putting burden to already vulnerable communities with limited resources (food and water). Authorities and the local community members are trying to mitigate the impact of the floods in residential areas. However, flood risks are still high considering the flow of water to downstream areas of River Shabelle as water levels in Belet Weyne are receding. In this proposal, AADSOM will improve access to safe water, sanitation facilities and promote good hygiene practices to reduce the negative impacts of the flood in Jalalaqsi district. Under this allocation, AADSOM will improve better access to clean water, use of latrines and increased health promotion and safe hygiene practices to 20,000 women, men, boys and girls including people with disabilities and marginalized communities affected by the current floods. Key activities AADSOM would like to undertake within this project include:\n- Provision of safe water to 1000 households representing 6,000 men, women and children affected population through water vendors (water trucking) by using Water Voucher (WV) \n- Upgrade/Rehabilitation of one strategic borehole equipped with hybrid system and rehabilitation of flood damaged 20 shallow wells with hand pumps. \n- Capacity building of 11 WASH committees and 42 Well Operators to ensure continuity of service, operation and maintenance, coupled training on DDR and conflict resolution mechanisms as cross cutting\n- Construction flood destructed 214 gender separated and flood proof latrines and 6 gender sensitive flood proof institutional latrines in Nasrudin Primary School with lockable doors to avoid GBV against women and girls and washing basin benefiting around 245 students.\n- Conducting comprehensive hygiene promotion campaigns to reach 20,000 men, women, boys and girls through visiting house to house, schools, health centers and feeding centers \n-Training 15 community hygiene promoters, who will carry out hygiene promotion activities during and after the project is faced out and \n-Distribution of 1000 HP kits to 1000 households (UNICEF will supply) with vulnerable populations served by the established water services. \nThe proposed response took into consideration the impact of women, and children in terms of access to WASH services.

The nutrition cluster priority districts in Hiran region including Beletweyne due to critical levels of GAM rate at 19.6 and SAM of 4.1. The project is designed in such a way that while providing emergency lifesaving interventions it will also provide longer term sustainable solutions for affected populations. To ensure the emergency interventions are linked to durable solutions, the project includes construction, rehabilitation and upgrading of water supply systems and promotion of hygiene and sanitation services.\n\nThe project will contribute to improving equitable access to quality life-saving curative and preventative health, nutrition and WASH services through the support of static health facilities and mobile outreach to the flood affected populations in Hiran, particularly Beletweyne District. There will be 8 sites that will provide integrated health and nutrition services for flood affected communities, offering outpatient consultations, routine immunization, maternal healthcare, disease surveillance and health promotion as well as systematic identi\ufb01cation, referral and treatment of acutely malnourished cases by providing integrated nutrition services to OTPs, TSFP, IYCF-E and referral to stabilization centers. Micronutrient supplementation, promotion of IYCF practices, promoting the adoption of good hygiene and sanitation practices will also be provided. Special focus will be given to prevention of disease outbreak and malnutrition, improve early identification malnutrition by empowering mothers to use MUAC screening, access to primary health care, and therefore reduce excess morbidity and mortality. \n\nThe WASH component in health and nutrition will also improve good hygiene practices, rehabilitation of WASH infrastructure, more equitable and better access to sustainable water points for drinking and handwashing with soap, and provision of basic sanitation services in these facilities. Hygiene and sanitation support and promotion will be provided in an integrated approach in the health and nutrition sites. There will also be outreach nutrition, hygiene and health promotion within the community and in schools. This will empower children to be agents of change for hygiene promotion.",

        "description": "The Somalia NGO Consortium (SNC) was first established in 1999 as a network of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) working together to improve international aid coordination and raise the presence and profile of NGO representation within the aid coordination structure for Somalia. Since inception, the Somalia NGO Consortium has grown as an effective network, actively supporting its members to promote dialogue, collaboration, learning experiences, information exchange and to advocate on issues of key concern. Currently, the Consortium is the primary NGO coordination and representation mechanism, with a membership of 93 national and international NGOs working in all parts of Somalia/Somaliland, around humanitarian, development, peace-building, health, education among other thematic areas.  Governed by a Steering Committee elected by the membership, the SNC provides a platform for information-sharing and representation to governments, UN agencies, donor groups and multilateral organisations at local, national and international levels. The Consortium has offices and representation in Mogadishu, Hargeisa, Garowe, Baidoa, Kismayo and plans to expand its reach to constituencies in the remaining federal states through extensive outreach work from the current offices. The SNC expects to reach 100 NGOs by end of 2019 which will increase membership needs. The SNC is currently co-funded through Swiss Development Cooperation (SDC), Somalia Humanitarian Fund (SHF), OFDA (USAID), Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA) and membership subscription fees. Legal and contractual responsibilities associated with funding and contracting are held by host agencies, as SNC is not a legally constituted entity, but rather a network of its membership. During the relocation process in 2019, the SNC has gone through transitions on multiple levels including management and relocation form Nairobi to Mogadishu. Our costs and needs from our membership have significantly increased and significant positions are left unfilled including Advocacy Officer, Deputy Director and Grants amp Partnership Officer. SNC's annual budget for 2020 is estimated to be around $1,409,806 USD. Further information can be found below on budget secured and proposals submitted.",

        "description": "TThe NGO safety program was established in 2004 to support NGOs operating in Somalia in terms of staff safety. In this complex context, NGOs face strong challenges related to access and security, including: a lack of understanding of the context difficulty to access and to verify information a lack of information sharing a lack of security coordination and harmonized security practices poor security awareness of staff and a lack of training opportunities. This safety platform is managed since April 2015 by INSO.\n\nIn response to and following the guidance of an Advisory Board (which is composed by 4 INGOs and 1 LNGOs), the project focuses on two main pillars of action which can be summarized as Information, Analysis and Advice, and Preparedness and Response. The two pillars are strongly interconnected: NGOs need accurate and timely security information to base their decisions on, while they need the proper safety training to organize and take relevant security decisions. Finally, in case an incident takes place, NGOs receive adequate support.\n\nThrough INSO\u2019s own network of Deputy Safety Advisors and Safety Advisor Assistants, NGO reports, collaboration with other security actors and media follow up, INSO collects, verifies, compiles and analyses security incidents. Besides, since 2010, the project has developed a database of more than 41,000 incidents that constitutes a unique tool for data analysis. The INSO field teams help NGOs on the ground to deal with daily security incidents, such as arrests, accidents and threats, while the INSO senior management team can provide support to critical incidents such as kidnappings, abductions, injuries and medical evacuations. The extent of INSO involvement is determined by the NGO who requests our services.\n\nDue to the peculiar mandate and mission of INSO, its Hargeisa office has a dual role, both as coordination hub and implementer of core INSO activities (such as roundtables, individual briefings, and production of maps and reports). Likewise, senior management (including the Country Director) are highly involved in the direct delivery of our services: they are not just managers but also direct implementers in their role as advisors to other NGOs. \n\nThe project budget leans heavily on HR costs because the project\u2019s core product is knowledge. That\u2019s in essence what INSO\u2019s beneficiaries receive. When the main output of an organization is information, the organization core cost is HR \u2013 same as e.g. an online newspaper or a management consulting firm.",

        "description": "The overall goal of the project is to contribute to improvement of living conditions and access to basic services for displaced in persons by bolstering effectiveness of coordination mechanisms and community led governance structures in Luuq which is a CCCM under-served area. The envisaged actions will set the foundation for attaining durable solutions through strengthened community self-management. DRC will facilitate the analysis of needs and intervention gaps within IDP sites in Luuq, initiating advocacy for support to respond to identified needs and gaps, as well as protection concerns. DRC will also contribute to the administrating and documenting regular cluster meetings in collaboration with UNHCR. DRC will engage local authorities including governmental and community leadership to work towards durable solutions for displaced populations. \n\nThe project will engage implementing partners and relevant authorities on identified needs, gaps, and overlaps. Furthermore, DRC will advocate for and support the adoption of an area-based approach for service delivery in IDP sites. The project will conduct training of relevant government authorities in CCCM principles to enhance their understanding of humanitarian assistance through the CCCM model.\n\nDRC will take on responsibility for targeted IDP sites to undertake the following:\n- Map out existing governance structures and focal points at the targeted IDP sites. Where governance structures exist, their capacity will be built in camp management and other essential principles. Where these governance structures are absent, DRC will facilitate their establishment through the creation of Camp Management Committees (CMCs).\n- Monitor service delivery in the IDP sites through CCCM Mobile Teams to identify any service gaps and overlaps of interventions by implementing agencies.\n- Reinforce accountability to displaced populations through increasing communication and feedback on availability of services. This will be done through multiple approaches including construction and establishment of community centers for information hubs, and through awareness raising campaigns about site services. Furthermore, DRC will establish and strengthen complaint and feedback mechanisms (CFMs) in sites. For referrals, DRC will work with existing protection stakeholders on appropriate and principled referrals, with particular attention to protection concerns, and service delivery to persons with special needs.\n- Work to improve site safety and hygiene through a participatory approach, utilizing a cash-for-work modality to carry out site maintenance activities. This additionally links participating IDP residents to temporary income and encourages ownership of the site. Site safety audits and fire hazard training will also be conducted.\n\nBeneficiary description:\nThe proposed intervention supports multiple stakeholders through camp management activities at the targeted five IDP sites with the aim of increased coordination at the site level, for displaced populations in  Luuq, where the established governance structures will hold monthly coordination meetings at the site level to discuss gaps and needs of IDP residents so that these identified gaps and needs will be taken  to the relevant humanitarian partners who assist in filling those gaps at the targeted sites.\nAt the present time, based on discussions with relevant stakeholders, DRC has selected the following sites to support:\n1.Ban Munduli (Akaro) - 715 H\u2019H\n2.Buyle - 520 H\u2019H\n3.Luuq Hilaac - 355 H\u2019H\n4.Jazeera - Jadiid - 450 H\u2019H\n5.Luuq Waaberi - 460 H\u2019H",

The project intervention is timely significant to address and respond to the education cluster and drought response plan (June-December 2019) strategies: i) prioritize education support to children where they live and ii) education opportunity to children in place where they move to ensure they can continue their education. Education is critical during emergencies like drought. It protects children from risks and protection related concerns. School-aged children will be provided lifesaving education intervention to schools they are currently learning to prevent the risk of dropout as well as mitigate the protection risks. Equally, school-aged children who are displaced by the drought will be reached out to their places to ensure they have access to quality education and protection services in locations they moved to the proposed project will be targeting 4000 school aged children affected by the drought in 18 schools in Belethawa (4 schools), Bardhere (4 schools), Luuq (5 schools), Garbaharey (2 schools) and Burdhubo(3). The project will target 4000 school-aged drought affected children in Gedo (2,200 boys and 1,800 girls). Education specific activities will include the provision of education supplies: As per the education minimum standard on teaching and learning materials, learners and teachers will be provided learning materials in accordance to set standards. Each grade 1-3 student will receive learning kit consisting of 7 books (6 single ruled and 1 single Squared100 sheets), 4 pencils, 4 rubbers and 2 sharpeners while students between Grade 4 and 8 will receive  7 books ((6 single ruled and 1 single Squared 100 sheets), 2 pens,2 rubbers , 1 sharpener and one student mathematics set. Bags will be given the girls provided for the sanitary kits to carry their sanitary materials to the schools to reduce their absence during menstrual period, emergency school feeding to promote retention of learners, emergency teacher incentives to motivate teachers, training of teachers and CECs on education and child protection, and sanitary kits for adolescent girls to encourage their regular attendance at school. WASH Specific activities will include water trucking to the schools and construction of water storages (Barkets), the construction of gender segregated school latrines with hand-washing facilities.  As education is lifesaving, protection mainstreaming will be key and critical to ensure children have access to protective learning environment. HIRDA will conduct protection service mapping in the target schools. The members will be able to identify children with protection concern both at the school and community. They also, help in organising children led social mobilization campaign in the community. Also, organise structured recreational activities in the school4000 (1800 girls) learners will be provided with recreational materials as per the education cluster minimum standard. Children in the target locations will have access to structured recreational play in the schools. Through the recreational materials, children will have access to play and interact with other children. Children clubs will also be established in the target schools.\n\nHIRDA has been active education partner as well as nutrition and health. Based on its vast experienced field staff who benefited trainings offered by the education cluster and UNICEF, HIRDA will be directly implementing this project. The project will complement the ongoing alternative basic education, health and nutrition programmes funded by UNICEF. School-aged children will have access to nutrition screening exercise to identify children with acute malnutrition and treated. Equally, the health HIRDA team will prioritise the target schools to ensure children are dewormed and treated communicable diseases and illnesses.",

        "description": "The proposed project seeks to improve  immediate access to food and to protect and restore the livelihood-related food and income sources for the most vulnerable rural H.H living in rural  Baidoa villages in Bay region - Somalia. The project targets 1,350 households comprising of 8,247 boys, girls, women and Men. Project period will be 6 months. The primary target will be the most vulnerable families under the integrated food security classification (IPC) 3 and above that are currently living in  rural Baidoa villages. Target will be mainly villages of northern Baidoa namely Lawiiley (9km), Midow (12km) and Maaranka (15km) and small villages around these three. The assistance will be emergence-oriented agricultural support to 1350 rain fed farmers living in the target villages to secure harvest in the coming Deyr rainy season. The project will provide each family a package of farming seeds (sorghum (30kg) and cowpea (10kg)) and farming tools. The beneficiary farmers will be trained on the best agricultural practice/ good agricultural practice (GAP) to enhance and develop their capacities on farming. \nComplementary unconditional cash transfer (UCT) will be transferred to the target beneficiaries in a period of 3 months to improve immediate food access during the lean season. The monthly rate of the cash transfer is $30/family. This complies with March 2019 minimum expenditure basket (MEB) value recommended by CMWG in May 2019. It is anticipated that the cash transfer support will improve their food consumption, nutritional status of the children and reduce the use of negative coping mechanisms that exposes women, children and other vulnerable groups to the risk of displacement. \nWith the funds from SHF, QC will work closely with state level and local level authorities, local elders, community members and drought affected population to undertake and determine the project beneficiaries. During the beneficiary identification process QC will consider child-headed households, households headed by disabled persons or elderly persons without support Households with children under 5 poor female-headed households poor households with children admitted in nutrition programs, poor pregnant and lactating women. Public verification will be made which will surely encourage accountability, transparency and fair selection. The project will extend feedback and compliant mechanism already in place where beneficiaries can be able to present their concerns for assistance.",

        "description": "The underperforming Deyr rains in 2018 and Gu rains in 2019 have heavily impacted the lives and livelihoods of households in Diinsoor which has led to an increase in the number of households in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis) and IPC Phase 4 (emergency). Rural populations in the hard-to-reach and undeserved areas around Diinsoor have been severely affected as result of poor agricultural production and limited access to services due to limited coverage by aid agencies. Household debt levels in this area remain high with many households utilizing negative coping mechanisms as a means to survive this lean period. Findings from a rapid needs assessment conducted by ACTED in Diinsoor on 16 and 23 June found that 62% of households do not regularly meet their food needs. Due to this dire situation, ACTED proposes an emergency short-term response to address the acute food insecurity and alleviate the humanitarian needs. The project will provide life-saving support to 1,614 vulnerable and drought affected households (9,684 individuals) through unconditional cash transfers in Diinsoor. ACTED plans to distribute four-months of consecutive unconditional cash transfers to these households from August until November 2019. Overall, these activities align with the Food Security cluster objective to improve households\u2019 immediate access to food through provision of conditional and unconditional assistance depending on the severity of food insecurity phase vulnerability and seasonality of the livelihoods. Moreover, the project aligns with the Somalia HRP 2019 objective to provide life-saving and life sustaining integrated assistance to reduce acute humanitarian needs and excess mortality among the most vulnerable people. Unconditional cash transfers act as a measure to prevent further deterioration of the food security of households and act as a buffer against the continued impact of the failed rains. These unconditional transfers in Diinsoor provide a quick response to increasing needs and enable households to access the functioning markets in Diinsoor.",

        "description": "FSNAU forecasts worsening food security and nutrition situation in the (2nd -3rd quarters) of 2019 in middle Shabelle region. Poor nutrition may deteriorate further with delayed rain and the impending drought. The FSNAU projects the GAM in Balcad district at 16% and SAM at 3.1%. The Nutrition Cluster estimates about 2,900 SAM cases annually in Balcad district with an estimated population of about 210,000 (including 21,000 IDPs). Zamzam in partnership with UNICEF has been providing integrated health and nutrition services in Bal'ad district since 2007 and this call for proposals (Reserve drought 2019) will serve to ensure the continuation of project activities to mitigate drought impact and cover the nutrition/health needs of children , women and men at target locations. The proposed project, which will be implemented from July 2019-July 2020 will provide a package of life-saving integrated interventions for vulnerable populations, including women and children, affected by drought conditions in targeted areas in Bal'ad district. Under this project, Zamzam will scale up its intervention through two integrated health/nutrition sites and 2 mobile outreach services targeting 35000 drought-affected people of 55% are women and girls. Zamzam proposes the following health/nutrition interventions: \n\n1. Deliver integrated Health, Nutrition services through two fixed health facilities and 2 mobile teams : The services to be provided include vitamin A supplementation (VAS) for children 6-59 months, immunization for children less than one year and referrals. (at least 4300 children under-5 are given two VAS ,and deworming tablets and immunized(disaggregated by sex). In addition, an estimated 2800 Pregnant women in their 2nd and 3rd trimesters are dewormed. \n2. Outpatient consultations, management of common child illness like Pneumonia , diarrhea , antenatal care services, sexual reproductive health and MISP in emergency. \n3. Screen children for malnutrition and malnourished children (6-59) referred by CNW to appropriate programme (TSFP/OTP, SC) for treatment. The two fixed nutrition/health sites and 2 mobile teams will provide at least 5 out of 9 BNSP components. This will allow us to treat 7000 children with MAM and 2,900 children (6-59 months) with SAM, including 290 with medical complication are treated by August 2020. UNICEF/WFP will provide all the supplies needed for treatment in-kind. \n4. Promote, enable and sustain behaviour change related to improve infant and young child feeding (IYCF-E). Zamzam will implement mother-led MUAC approach and train community health workers on IYCF promotion to allow them to support 5 Pregnant and lactating women receive individual/group counselling for IYCF and increased service uptake at community level.\n5. Capacity building: The capacity of staff will be improved IMCI , IMAM ,Early warning/early response, IYCF -E while the community members will have participate community health education and awareness session on AWD prevention and response. \n6. Improve reporting, monitoring and maintain Integrated Disease Surveillance and action. at least the health/nutrition sites report monthly DHIS/ONA to the government , health and nutrition cluster",

The target group will be selected from those impacted by drought with limited humanitarian support due to access difficulties and blockade. \n\nAVORD will adapt systematic approach to beneficiary selection with clear criterion to prioritize the most vulnerable such as the marginalized, unaccompanied children, older persons, persons with disability, single women, pregnant and lactating mothers, single headed-households, persons with chronic illness or psychological condition, large families and/or families with babies, toddlers or children attending school, persons at risk as identified by protection officers and those living in the open or in makeshift buuls without adequate access to shelter. The project team will undertake a vulnerability assessment involving documenting of household profiles in the target area to identify the most vulnerable who are in urgent need for shelter assistance. Data will be collected through a number of methods including structured interviews with households heads, Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) and direct site observation. Collected data to inform beneficiary selection will also be segregated by gender to ensure that no group is left-out. List of beneficiaries along with their contact numbers will be availed to SHF and other actors responding in the area as needed to avoid overlap. Mindful of the Somali context and utilizing its expertise in target locations, AVORD will pay attention to issues of diversity in the targeting process. \n\nFollowing need-based and transparent selection of beneficiaries, AVORD will provide affected households with standard NFI kits comprising of 1 Plastic Sheet, 3 Blankets, 2 Sleeping Mats, I Kitchen Set, 1 Mosquito Net, 1 Solar Torch and 2 Jerry Cans with the capacity of 10 Liters each. The proposed content in each set is based on current Shelter Cluster standards for people in humanitarian emergencies. Since there are no functioning NFI markets in No.50, AVORD will use an in-kind modality for provision of NFIs. Besides, emergency shelters will be constructed for newly displaced households living in the open or under deplorable shelter conditions. In the construction of these shelters, the project team will ensure adequate separation between individual household shelters and that pathways exist to provide all-weather access to individual dwellings and facilities. AVORD will closely coordinate with relevant line ministries of the South West Administration and No.50 District Authorities to secure land tenure for a minimum of 5 years before the construction of emergency shelters.\n\nThe effectiveness of the aid package will be ascertained through Post Distribution Monitoring exercise thus ensuring that beneficiaries access their services safely and in a dignified manner. An elaborate feedback and complain mechanism will be setup to ensure accountability to the affected population.\n\nIn the delivery of the proposed package, AVORD will seek Integration with other clusters and own interventions in the region to ensure complementarity, value for money and efficiency of the response.",

Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are expected from June to September in parts of central Somalia, where livestock holdings are lowest, and in northeasternSomalia, where the economy is more dependent on livestock, seafood, and frankincense exports. The socioeconomic impacts of COVID-19have led to a 30-50 % decline in annual external remittances, an anticipated 25-35 % decline in annual livestock exports, lower labour demand, and above average imported staple food prices.\nBesides adverse weather conditions and conflict resulting in food insecurity and hunger, other prevailing challenges in the project areas Oxfam and partners Candlelight, Havoyoco and KAALO work are poor access to water and inadequate hygiene and sanitation conditions, as well as displacement. Against this backdrop,  the proposed activities aim at assisting both IDPs and host communities. Access to clean and safe water is a major area of concern in our intervention areas in Somaliland and Puntland.\nOur proposed activities focus on relieving the distress suffered by affected families, preventing their situation from getting worse and strengthening collective resilience mechanisms. In terms of sectors we will focus on Food Security <(>&<)> Livelihoods (FSL), Water, Sanitation <(>&<)> Hygiene (WASH), Protection (PRO), Multi-Purpose Cash (MPCT) and Accountability (ACC).\nOxfam and partners Candlelight, Havoyoco and KAALO will work in the following regions and districts/locations: Awdal (Baki), Sool (Las Anod, Xudun, Bocaame), Sanaag (Eerigavo), Bari (Bossaso), Mudug (Jariiban). Partners have been implementing SOMJR activities in these regions and locations since 2019 (Awdal, Sool, Sanaag) and 2020 (Bari, Mudug), and were able to invest in the resilience building of target communities. Bocaame in Sool has been added as a new location to the SOMJR: it has already been targeted by partner KAALO during the DRA-funded Desert Locust Joint Response (May to October 2020), however, needs remain high as Bocaame is highly affected by insecurity and recurring waves of desert locust invasions.",

        "description": "Our strategy combines service delivery, such as trainings, with influencing interventions to change policies, laws, attitudes and beliefs. This has proved successful in the last three years. The strategy engages young women and men from diverse backgrounds to be a driving force for social progress and optimism about the future in their respective countries and across Africa.\nWhen we worked with stakeholders in each country to analyse the current situation faced by young men and women, we found three common key needs:\n1. Improving curricula and training methods, creating new modules and connecting the curricula to the demands of the market.\n2. Innovation to respond to social issues such as climate change, gender rights and urbanization.\n3. Linking service delivery interventions with influencing interventions # young people do not need only better training and new skills, but also changes to the system: policies, laws, practices and the attitudes and beliefs of their fellow citizens, employers and the government.\nThese conclusions have guided this proposal in further developing interventions and adapting activities for each country for 2020-2022. We will highlight new interventions in the following chapters.\nOur strategy is based on systems thinking:trying to understand how different parts of a system interact to effect change, rather than understanding specific components in isolation. Systems thinking can help to develop truly sustainable and transformative change. The below graphic illustrates the#system# for youth seeking employment in Somaliland, mappingthe relationships of actors including education institutions, hubs, teachers, government, banks, entrepreneurs, families and media.",

The Food Security and Livelihoods component of the project will deliver Multi-Purpose Cash to assist vulnerable households to access food and other necessities. Oxfam will collaborate with the Ministry of Livestock in a livestock vaccination campaign to treat the most common endo and ecto parasites to improve animal health in pastoralist communities, and will further work with vulnerable youth and women to diversify their livelihoods with vocational skills training and piloting of Voluntary Savings Groups. This will help increase employability and income, and will also contribute to building the capacity of women to take a more active role in decision making in their communities. The project will incorporate specific community protection activities engaging community protection volunteers, existing community committees and women#s groups to raise and mitigate protection risks at community level. Oxfam will map available services in target communities and engage with service providers on confidential referral pathways. Trainings on basic protection principles, rights and responsibilities will target community committees, women#s groups, community protection volunteers and relevant authorities will be capacity built to strengthen regional and national protection mechanisms.",

        "description": "Sanaag and Sool regions have been facing both acute and chronic water shortages for many years. The prolonged droughts experienced in 2016/2017 have seriously affected the local communities and the water facilities too. The traditional water facilities, such as shallow wells, water pans, dams frequently dry out and there are very few boreholes-which frequently breakdown due to high demand and overuse. Badhan for instance, has a high population (89,435 people) in Eastern Sanaag, and is an old town with no permanent water sources. During the dry period, people trek more than 100km to the nearest water points, while the water prices unreasonably increase to more than 300% (Adeso internal reports). Qawlo under Taleex has similar water needs as Badhan, with an estimated population of 73,529 (UNPFA 2014 data). These 2 locations (Badhan and Qawlo) are highly populated with large rural and [pastoral population and they frequently face water shortages.  \nAdeso propose to drill and equip strategic boreholes in these 2 main centers with adequate water distribution system. The project will be implemented together with the private sector, community and the government to ensure contributions from all stakeholders, the ownership and foreseeable sustainability. Our strategy is to encourage a participatory process with the key stakeholders being involved, develop local ownership and strengthen governance structure for such response. Adeso will enhance this strategy to enable value for money and high impact for this project.  The community and the private sector will contribute 20% of the total cost of Badhan borehole (that is equivalent to $40,000).\nThe drilling and equipping will be done through a competent local contractor, thoroughly vetted by the community, the government and Adeso technical team. Adeso will hire a water engineer, fully dedicated for this project and ensure the expected standards are met. The same contractor will do the hydro-geological survey, identify the best aquifer, present report for deliberation before moving to the actual drilling.  Adeso has strong experience in Somalia and combining hydro-geological survey and drilling into one contract will ensure smooth operation and that the contractor meets the expectation as per the contract.  Adeso will carry out, through its WASH team, an environmental and social impact analysis that may come as a result of the new borehole and apply the necessary mitigation measures in good time.  The proposed boreholes will have several distribution systems, including different water points for the livestock to avoid water contamination. \nThe project will also construct latrines for the poor households, hygiene and sanitation awareness as well as strengthening the water governance structures. The ministries of water, both from Somaliland side for Talex / Qawlo site and Puntland side for Badhan will be involved to ensure the government support and also the response meet the government vision of providing adequate water to the people. \nA water ground breaking analysis will be done to determine the chemical, mineral and the biological analysis of the water.  This will be done as soon as the ground water is hit before any further work is done. The region has a history of salinity and great care needs to be taken with this, so if one aquifer fails or becomes saline, then the contractor moves to another site until the best water quality is achieved. \nAdeso is currently implementing an OFDA funded WASH project in these regions, that has mainly rehabilitation of the rural water facilities-such as shallow wells, boreholes, water pans with hygiene and sanitation components. A climate change adaption project is also being implemented in building community resilience to shocks / adaptation. Adeso recently concluded a 5 year EU Natural resource management program. These interventions provide strong complementarity to the proposed response that will result in high impact.",

        "description": "The humanitarian situation in Northern Somalia in 2018 remains fragile due to residual impact of drought, Cyclone Sagar, conflict and ongoing displacement. While the risk of famine has reduced, humanitarian needs remain high, with extreme water and pasture shortages reported in rainfall deficit areas of Bari, Nugaal, Sool and Sanaag regions. Water scarcity in Sool and Sanaag regions has reached a precarious level, affecting the health of the most vulnerable people and causing occasional resource-based clan conflicts. With only a third of the population having access to improved sanitation, poor hygiene practices (including frequent open defecation) are prevalent, contributing to incidences of water-borne diseases. Consequently, there is an urgent need to improve WASH service delivery at district level. \n\nIn this context, ACTED will implement a WASH cluster-specific intervention aiming to 1) Provide reliable and sustained access to sufficient safe water, based on identified strategic water points 2) Establish an appropriate system for the management and maintenance of facilities, with different groups contributing equitably and 3) Enhance community sanitation and hygiene awareness. \n\nACTED will implement these activities in Taleex district of Sool region, and Erigavo and Dararweyne districts of Sanaag region, targeting a highly vulnerable and largely undeserved area. Approximately 15,000 people (2,500 households) will benefit from this intervention, in addition to creating synergies for improved coordination among WASH stakeholders in the area, including local authorities, clusters and other NGOs. These numbers might vary due to external factors such as the drought, which might attract more IDPs, or escalation of conflict, which may cause communities to flee to other areas.",

        "description": "The planned FSL project intervention is cluster specific response that conforms to the Humanitarian Response Plan for 2019 and the 1st 2018 SHF Standard Allocation for the Food Security and Livelihood as it applies to project planned target District of Hobyo (South Mudug Region). The project will provide lifesaving support to 7,704 people assessed to be in acute food insecurity, \u2018Crisis\u2019 and \u2018Emergency\u2019 phases of IPC (3 and 4)  by providing them with a means to sustained access to food and safety net support.\n\nThe project proposes lifesaving interventions that are gender sensitive, adapt centrality of protection and that mainstream gender and protection in the delivery methods proposed. The project will specifically prioritize destitute pastoralists and IDP households, women from the destitute households left behind in identified accessible settlements (hard to reach areas especially such as rural areas of the two Districts) and other households as identified in the Hobyo Districts that fall into the IPC 3 and 4. The planned project activities will help mitigate the effects of the failure of the Deyr 2018 season rains in Central Somalia Region. \n\nThe project seeks to improve households\u2019 immediate access to food to 733 vulnerable households through Unconditional Cash Transfers (UCTs) for 3 months with each household being entitled US $71 as per MEB for Mudug Region. The project will undertake a vulnerability assessment in selected locations of the targeted 4 locations in the District (2 settlements with IDPs and 2 settlements with high number of vulnerable host households) with the findings being used in developing the criteria for selection of the planned UCT beneficiaries and informing on protection needs.  Priority for the UCTs beneficiaries will be given to women-led households from the most vulnerable among recently displaced, non-displaced and socially marginalized communities in each of the respective target District. The UCTs planning will also be supported by a market analysis undertaken in the District (undertaken by the FSL Team) to determine the capacity of local markets to absorb the resources extended to the beneficiaries. \n\nIn addition the project will undertake Conditional Cash Transfer for 451 unskilled laborers rehabilitating 3 Water Pans.  Each unskilled labourer of the planned 410 CfW laborers shall get $ 5 per day for 30 days and 41 skilled laborers at the rate of US 7. A total of 6,000 CUM water impounding capacity will be added to the current existing 1,080 CUM in the 3 targeted dams in Hobyo District. The project will also support the protection of the core breeding and milking herds normally under the care of women in the rural and urban settlements through supportive treatments. This will involve the creation of the requisite animal treatment capacity (currently missing) involving the provision of fixed value animal treatment vouchers.  A total of 1,000 animals in the district are targeted where each HH is estimated to be keeping 10 Shoats. A total of 100 HHs will be targeted in the District. \n\nThe project will provide for continuous community engagement during the implementation process to ensure that the project gets feedback from the beneficiary community necessary for determining the effectiveness of the response and arising gaps that will require humanitarian response. This is particularly necessary given the prediction of a possible below average rainfall for the coming Gu 2019 season as indicated by FEWSNET in its January 2019 update.\n\nThe project will also mainstream gender and protection components in order to ensure it supports inclusiveness of both genders but in particular helps make women a priority in the design as direct beneficiaries ensuring the resultant benefits of the project accrue to them. The project will also ensure there is adequate protection of women in all the venues and staging points of the project to ensure it provides the women safety and protection required.",

To extend case management of childhood illness beyond health facilities, Community Health Workers (CHWs) will be trained on prevalent conditions such as management of fever, diarrhea and respiratory illnesses, and malaria. They will also refer all pregnant women to health facilities for care and encourage safe deliveries at facilities. The focus will be on early case identification and treatment, referral and compliance to treatment using the community\u2019s own mechanisms. CHWs will be trained on referral systems, and equipped with referral slips and a register to refer cases to the static MCHs. CHWs will be tasked with dissemination of pertinent health information, including preventive reproductive health and immunization activities, and in disease surveillance.\n\nReproductive health services will be provided and include the provision of equitable access to prenatal and postnatal health services provision of access to facility-based safe deliveries at static sites training of health staff on early detection, treatment and referral of pregnancy-related complications. CARE will establish referral pathways for CEMOC and complicated IMCI cases to three district hospitals currently supported by CARE (Lascanood, Erigavo and Badhan).  CARE will therefore support training for service providers focused on Clinical Management of Rape (CMR), psycho social support in coordination with GBV working groups in target areas.CARE will conduct training  for midwives and nurses in collaboration with CARE protection team, MOH and UNFPA on CMR. Targeted health workers will be sensitized about the health consequences of GBV and trained to identify and refer GBV survivors, while ensuring confidentiality and respect, response to survivors in a non-stigmatized way and provision of clinical care.

Capacity of local staff and MoH will be enhanced through training,involvement in actual activities and prioritizing local community in staff employment .This program will be integrated with nutrition and protection services in the same areas, creating a cost effective program that provides value for money with sustainable impact.\nSAF UK has been running health programs in 2 of the proposed  locations for about 2 years.Unfortunately the project funded by UNICEF ended on 30th January 2019. Funds have not been secured to continue interventions. The project therefore seeks to reinstate these health projects , but at the same time scale up to reach areas not reached, especially those with global acute malnutrition (GAM) rates more than 15%. This will be done through 8 teams in  3 health facilities (fixed sites) and  5 mobile clinics. Mobile clinics will move to different designated sites everyday.

HIDIG will leverage of its ongoing WASH and nutrition activities to provide access to an integrated life-saving health services to an estimated 21,000 drought affected and urban poor host communities in Baidoa district through one static health facilities, and six mobile clinics, with a focus on maternal and child Health in partnership with the Ministries of Health and other healthcare service providers. The SHF funds will be used to support a critical response integrated with WASH and nutrition to respond to the health needs of malnourished children and women in Baidoa. The proposed response aims to respond to only areas with critical rates of malnutrition and measles and suspected AWD/Cholera hotspots where immediate provision of lifesaving emergency healthcare is intended to be carried out. For example, Bay region accounts for 48% of all measles cases in South Somalia which make up five regions. HIDIG implemented health project in Baidoa district in partnership with SHF in 2018, which has ended. To build on the gains achieved in 2018 and the ongoing routine immunization support from UNICEF, the proposed project will provide free emergency obstetric care including ANC, skilled delivery and PNC to 1,050 eligible women and improve referral system through provision of timely transportation. Overall, 21,000 direct beneficiaries, including 5,040 girls, 4,200 boys, 6,510 women, 5,250 men will benefit from the services. The organization will conduct routine and supplementary measles immunization targeted at children under-five in target areas. In addition, the capacity of 35 staff will be improved through training so that frontline staff in disaster events marked by a sudden or gradual increase in demand for healthcare services and a related decrease in the supply of resources available to provide such care can act. This will result in a community healthcare-sector response that can implement a variety of surge capacity strategies that include steps taken to reduce demand for care, e.g., the implementation of community-based triage capabilities and risk communication about when to seek care and the strengthening of referral care capacity in addition to better described inpatient care strategies. In this context, fifty community members will also obtain an increased knowledge and skills on community management of childhood illnesses. HIDIG is an active health cluster member in Bay, Bakol and Hiiraan regions and will actively share information with the cluster, UNOCHA and the Ministry of Health, both at state level and federal. The target district is accessible, and the organization has an active PCA with UNICEF in reducing maternal mortality rate through skilled deliveries and strengthening referral system in Somalia. These proposed interventions adhere to the SHf\u2019s life-saving criteria as they respond to time-critical requirements and contribute to reducing the loss of lives. Bay region has more than 12,000 people in IPC 4 and 176,000 in IPC 3, indicating the scale of the acute malnutrition in the region. Because of this, HIDIG requires support and additional resources are urgently required as health and nutrition facilities are seeing more people in need. HIDIG will coordinate its interventions with respective line ministries and other NGOs to ensure there is no duplication in the response and that critical gaps are covered",

According to FSNAU post deryr 2018  assessment report indicated that deterioration of  nutrition situation in Sool region with GAM rate (lt15%) due to high morbidity, low immunization ,Vitamin-A supplementation, and poor care practices. Additionally, extreme water and pasture shortages have led to an increased incidence of acute watery diarrhea (AWD)/ cholera outbreaks, which have already been reported in many villages in Sool region. According to rapid assessment conducted by KAALO in February 2019  showed, majority of the health facilities in the assessed villages lacked basic supplies and staff incentives as well as shortage of appropriate reproductive health kits, supplies and commodities. KAALO in partnership with SHF and UNICEF has been implementing an integrated health and WASH project at target location since 2015.The health facilities are facing extreme funding gaps, shortage of supplies and poor referral system. KAALO proposes to scale up its health interventions to save lives, mitigate emergencies, reduce mortality amp morbidity and fill gaps of health services for drought affected people through 2 fixed health facilities with two mobile clinics targeting 28,000 direct beneficiaries including (7000 WCBA, 5600 children under five) in Sool region. The  sexual and reproductive health SRH intervention consists in supporting the provision of basic and comprehensive sexual and reproductive health services to all people at target districts and ensuring particularly the good health and well-being of mothers and newborns. This is done by supporting national health facilities in strengthening the health system strategy, equipping conflict-affected health facilities with emergency reproductive health kits, training health workers IMCI, BEmOC for reproductive health and deploying mobile teams in hard-to-reach areas to directly support the provision of services. Qualified nurses/ midwives will provide preventative and curative services, antenatal care, skilled delivery, postnatal care, treatment of common illnesses. The child health services include immunization of children under five years and promotion services including health education, growth monitoring, de-worming and supplementation with vitamin A. The mobile health teams will provide primary health Services for undeserved and hard to reach areas. They will also provide basic mental health and Psychosocial Support services and referral services. At the end of the project , a total of 28000 affected community (7000 women, 8400 girls, 8400 boys and 4200 men) improved and increased availability of health care including: promotive, preventative and curative services , reproductive health  and improved case management of childhood illnesses through two fixed health facilities with mobile outreach teams in Sool region.",

        "description": "The Nutrition and health situation remains fragile in Hobyo with children and women being most vulnerable. The key issues for children and women remain access to prevention and treatment interventions in the absence of a fully functional health system. Tied to that is minimal capacity available in the nutrition and health sector and  poor community literacy levels  (UNICEF 2018 WHO 2017). Malnutrition is one of the key issues affecting children 6-59 moths and significantly contributing to mortality, considering relationship between malnutrition and disease (UNICEF,2018, FSNAU,2018).\n Although there has been progress noted in service provision and policy development in Somalia including: roll out of national development plan with inclusion of a section on Nutrition and mainstreaming it to sectors (SNDP,2017), 2017-20 health sector strategic plan (FMoH,2017) and other health related policies, frameworks and guidelines,a lot still needs to be done to actualized these.\nIts important to note that disparities in health outcomes among Somali children and women still exist. These are based on: their exposure to violence and insecurity, access, gender and ethnic groupings, and the stability of communities/clan structure. Addressing these inequities, remains a priority (UNICEF,2018). This brings to light the fact that the situation in Hobyo  could be worse than national statistics considering that factors mentioned above fully exist here.\nServices in Hobyo barely reach rural areas because of poor infrastructure and harsh climate conditions. Therefore poor performing indicators like: Poor IYCF, low latrine coverage,low immunization coverage, severe food shortages and poor coverage of nutrition service/health facility are reported (WHO,2018SAF UK,2018 SARA ,2016 FSNAU,2019). There are reports of drought and food shortages causing many to leave there homes in search of food and water. The is therefore need for urgent attention if the situation is to be controlled.\nGender issues that lock out significant others increasing negative social pressure on women not to adapt behaviors beneficial to health, should be addressed for positive nutrition outcomes to be realized. Finally capacity of service providers and locals communities to control malnutrition should be improved for quality service, resilient communities and sustainable projects.\nThe proposed interventions will link with  cluster objective one, two and four, and SHF 2019 1 standard allocation core elements  one,three, four, five and six, which cover provision of immediate life saving and time critical interventions, focus on communities affected by deteriorating nutrition of GAMgt15% , integration of services across sectors, protection mainstreaming and rapid response  enabling the most urgent scaling up of essential humanitarian activities,\nInterventions will also seek to provide primary ,secondary and tertiary prevention for acute malnutrition, build resilience to cushion against shocks in future and provide a platform to discuss and initiate durable solutions  in conjunction with other clusters and relevant bodies thus preventing shocks and ensuring protection.\nSAF UK has been implementing nutrition (OTP,TSFP,MCHN and BSFP) and health projects in north Hobyo for 2 years, but only covering  Afbarwaqo and surrounding villages, reporting huge impact \nThis proposed project seeks to scale up treatment of MAM beyond our current coverage through additional 3 fixed sites in health facilities and 4 mobile sites to access hard to reach areas. Additionally,the current  supplementary feeding project funded by WFP expires on 30th March 2019. We hope to sustain these services (TSFP,MCHN and BSFP) ,avoiding gaps. \nOur proposal is  to provide supplementary feeding interventions (TSFP,MCHN and BSFP)  further integrating with health  project in all proposed sites for cost effective sustainable project",

        "description": ".The 2018 Deyr rainy season (October-December) was poor, with parts of Somaliland and Puntland receiving only 25-50% of average rainfall. Areas of particular concern include Northern Awdal and Woqooyi Galbeed, and Galkacayo IDP which are experiencing emergency (IPC Phase 4) conditions. GAM rates of 10-14.9% are present in Awdal, Woqooyi Galbeed and Togdheer. Similarly, the nutrition situation in Galkacayo IDPs is at a critical level and may deteriorate further without humanitarian assistance. According to the nutrition cluster nutrition burden estimate that was released in February 2019, in Galkayo IDPs, the nutrition situation was at a critical level with a GAM rate of 20.2% which is above the emergency threshold of GAMgt15%. Despite the high (estimated to be 61,092 by the health cluster) caseload of children with acute malnutrition in these regions, access to live saving nutrition services remains limited. In order to address these gaps, the proposed project will improve access and provide nutrition services to children aged 0 to 59 months and Pregnant and Lactating Women (PLW) with acute malnutrition through detection and treatment in the targeted nutrition sites. Particular attention will be on the following activities: Training of Community Volunteers in the identification and referral of malnutrition cases to Save the Children   supported   nutrition centers, and mothers trained in mother-led MUAC to enlarge coverage with close monitoring from Save the Children to prevent wrong referrals and ensure quality of the screening and understanding of the community Provision of Outpatient Therapeutic Feeding (OTP) services for children aged 6-59 months with Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) and Targeted Supplementary Feeding Program (TSFP) for Moderately Acute Malnourished children (MAM) and PLW through mobile outreach teams. Referring children aged 0-59 months identified with SAM coupled with medical complication, and SAM infants aged under 6 months with or without medical complications to the nearest stabilization center. The proposed nutrition project is mainly targeting Galkacayo IDPs (27), Awdal (30) and Woqooyi Galbeed (21) and Digaale and Jimaale HFs in Hargeisa IDPs locations, that are most affected by the current drought in Somalia. The project also promotes and supports optimal Infant and Young Child Feeding practices through the screening of breastfeeding difficulties amongst mothers of children under two years of age, provision of one to one counselling for mothers and caretakers with difficulties with regards to Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF) practices and raising awareness of caregivers and relatives on the importance of appropriate IYCF. The project is targeting 59,971 direct beneficiaries, 27,830 will be from the IDPs while 32,141 beneficiaries will be from the Host Communities. In addition, a total of  96,904 beneficiaries will be reached with key IYCF messages in the targeted areas. The proposed project will incorporate learnings from previous projects on how women and girls can participate meaningfully in nutrition interventions.One of the learnings is that mothers in the IDP settlements a lead role in championing for IYCF interventions once they receive sufficient training, this is because they gained a deeper understanding of the importance of breastmilk to children and were willing to breastfeed exclusively if they had a source of livelihood.Another learning is that women can be powerful agents of change when it comes to hygiene promotion once they understand the benefits of good hygiene practices and this has a positive impact on the whole community particularly as women tend to be the sole custodians of household and child rearing chores.",

It will also provide de-worming for children 12-59 months and pregnant women in the 2nd and 3rd trimester as well as counselling and promotion on infant and young child feeding compounded with health and hygiene promotion. Moreover, measles immunization will be provided to infants living within the catchment areas of the target health centers who are not immunized against measles. Systematic defaulter tracing for immunization services will also be conducted at community level. In order to strengthen the accountability with affected population, we will introduce mother-led MUAC approach to increase detection, identification and early referral of malnourished children.

This coupled with low levels of community awareness on issues of GBV stigma and other cultural barriers which encourage impunity for breaches in laws and convections. In Kismayo there has been a steady increase in GBV cases since December 2017. This has been attributed to the increasing levels of conflict in Juba land, being one of many active military zones and presence of military frontlines in the identified locations and a high number of IDP camps adjacent to the military camps. Increased forced evictions within the camps have also exposed more women and children to the risk of GBV in the camps thus increasing their vulnerability. \n\nAll the project activities will be carried out to maximize community participation. Regular meetings and capacity building activities at the established women and girl safe space will seek to engage the community in project activities and support the establishment and development of community networks in order to strengthen local mechanisms for prevention and response. By providing support to existing community structures the project will also seek to create women safe spaces to improve protection and to widen support networks. Medical support and psychosocial support with components of material support (dignity kits and solar lantern) coupled with livelihood support will be the backbone of this program.",

In drought affected regions, water scarcity and inadequate quality are leading causes of displacement and conflict, particularly in Puntland and Somaliland, where women and children must often travel over 30 minutes to reach drinking water points. Of the people in need and highly vulnerable, a large percentage are children, women and the elderly, who critically lack access to clean water and are acutely at risk of gender-related violence and high morbidity and mortality due to water-borne disease outbreaks. Many households lack access to adequate sanitation leading to frequent open defecation while safety of people, particularly women and children to access latrines and water points remains a serious concern and a serious risk for exposure to violence\n\nAn estimated 2.6 million people across Somalia remain internally displaced, either scattered among host communities in rural areas or living in formal and informal settlements on the fringes of urban areas. Most of the primary IDP settlements are in Crisis or Stressed in the presence of humanitarian assistance in Sanaag IDPs. The climatic situation is exacerbated by conflict in the Sanaag region. According to reports including those from Puntland\u2019s Humanitarian Affairs and Disaster Management Agency (HADMA), the situation remains tense and hostilities could resume. This would create further displacements and insecurity, and be a push factor towards areas where humanitarian actors are responding. \n\nIn this context, ACTED will implement a WASH cluster-specific intervention for IDPs and rural communities in areas affected by drought aiming to 1) Provide reliable and sustainable access to sufficient safe water, based on identified strategic water points and construction of new boreholes 2) Establish an appropriate system for the management and maintenance of facilities, with different groups contributing equitably and 3) Enhance community sanitation.\n\nACTED will implement these activities in Karasharka, Huluul, Habarshiro, Kalshiikh and Elbuh of Sanaag Region Approximately 25,000 people (4,167 households) will benefit from this intervention, in addition to creating synergies for improved coordination and collaboration among WASH stakeholders in the area, including local authorities, clusters and other NGOs. Specifically, ACTED has coordinated with OXFAM, who will be covering Lasanood, El-AFweyne, Kal sheikh, War-idhaad and Garadheg ) and Ainabo.",

        "description": "According to Humanitarian Dashboard (issued on 22 February 2019) by the Somalia WASH Cluster, several regions of Somaliland and Puntland are experiencing severe shortage of water, due to the over-exploitation of already-limited resources and the breakdown of equipment \u2013 the construction and restoration of water points are subsequently needed. The 2018 Deyr rainy season (October-December) was poor, with parts of Puntland receiving only 25-50% of average rainfall. Some regions have experienced drought for several seasons. Bari is among the regions worst affected by poor rains, with large moisture deficits and drought conditions.\n\nThe recurrent drought together with nutrition crises and other natural emergencies combined with poor WASH coverage and influx of internally displaced people (IDP) in target regions of Bari including Ishkushuban, Bosasso (IDPs), Qardho (IDPs) highlight the need for Save the Children to continue providing emergency services to vulnerable communities. \n\nTherefore, Save the Children is proposing a 12 months WASH project targeting drought and conflict affected communities in Bari regions targeting Ishkushuban, Bosasso (IDPs), Qardho (IDPs) to provide immediate life-saving WASH services to the most vulnerable members of the community, reaching a total of 48,889 individuals (men: 14,373, women: 14,960, boys: 9,778 and girls: 9,778).\n\nThe proposed project aims to provide lifesaving emergency and sustainable WASH service through drilling of two new strategic boreholes and rehabilitation of three strategic boreholes complete with hybrid power system (solar and diesel power), distribution systems, storage tanks and new water kiosks, and rehabilitation of rain water harvesting berkeds in rural target communities. The project will also improve overall hygiene and sanitation of the target communities through the construction of 150 shared household latrines  affected by the drought.\n\nIn terms of centrality and mainstreaming of protection, the project targets to reduce the risk of violence against women, children and vulnerable groups while accessing water and sanitation facilities by providing gender segregated facilities and establishing the facilities within 500 meters\u2019 distance of the settlements. The project will also address gender issues by collecting gender and age disaggregated data. Save the Children will analyze this data to identify gaps, provide gender sensitive interventions and ensure participation and empowerment of women. Save the Children will ensure protection during access and utilization of services, to reduce the risk further. \n\nThe project beneficiaries will be selected through a community consultative process with the community leaders and local authorities in order to ensure that only those who meet the specified vulnerability criteria including women and girls, people living with disability, people from minority clans, female headed households,  child-headed households,  survivors of sexual and gender base violence,  and households with a high number of dependents (children, elderly, people with disabilities, pregnant and lactating mothers will be given high priority. Save the Children will maintain and expand synergies across all the programs by ensuring that this project is implemented alongside the other emergency response programs, such as nutrition and health programs, to ensure that benefits arising out of multiple actions to the same target groups are exponentially increased.\n\nThe project is designed in such a way that while providing emergency lifesaving interventions it will also provide longer term sustainable solutions for affected population. To ensure the emergency interventions are linked to durable solutions, the project included construction, rehabilitation and upgrading of water supply systems and promotion",

        "description": "Limited access to safe water in Somaliland is endemic and is worsening with prolonged drought. Poor, below-average rainfall in northern and central Somalia during the Deyr season of 2018 has resulted in a harsher than normal dry season. \nMost water sources across Sool and Sanaag regions in the north are not suitable for human consumption and approximately half of the birkads are damaged, and a quarter of them did not harvest any run-off because of the lack of rains. In addition, poor access to latrines leads to prevalent open defecation across Somalia/land. \nThe aim of the proposed project is to provide lifesaving support to and rebuild resilience of affected communities through providing sustainable solutions to water access. Oxfam prioritizes activities that enable communities to access continued water supply from existing groundwater sources, reduce the walking distance for women/girls to fetch water at a reduced cost, contain human feaces contaminating the environment and surface water sources, and promote behavioural change on personal hygiene and handwashing at critical times.\nOxfam is present in hard-to-reach and in some of the most neglected geographical areas of Sool and Sanaag regions and continues to prioritize presence based on where the highest \u2018unreached\u2019 needs lie. There is a committed and robust humanitarian team (over 30+) in Somalia based out of a main office, a field office, and two sub-offices. The current team has strong technical capacity in response management, with technical coordinators for WaSH and a robust 3-person MEAL team that guides quality and accountability of programming in the field. Working with partners on some interventions/responses, also affords good complementarity in understanding the local context and assuring 2-way sharing of technical knowledge and skills that could enrich growth and progress in addressing the needs of the target population. \n\n2 desalination units are proposed in Oog and Garadag. Oxfam will engage in a public private partnership with Boreal Light (which has expertise in operating desalination plants and can provide operation and management training) and the Somaliland Ministry of Water Resource Development (MoWRD). Oxfam already has good relationships and experience with both parties, having closely collaborated around 2 existing desalination units funded in other areas by other donors. The MoWRD supports and endorses desalination work in Somaliland. \n\nBoreal Light is a leading actor in this sector, specialized in renewable energy solutions for water treatment facilities. It manufactures affordable solar water desalination systems and has extensive expertise in the region, including Kenya and Somaliland. It has identified a local agent in Somaliland who will be responsible for operating, maintaining and managing the desalination units under the SHF project for a period 12 months. The training provided in this time will present a sustainable model after the end of the project period. \n\nTo ensure value for money for this funding and program complimentary, ACTED and Oxfam will coordinate on key activities in Sanaag. At project inception, there will be a training workshop on key learning from WASH programming in the region to share experience: e.g. borehole drilling, sharing supplier lists and good practices in drilling and rehabilitation works, engagement with communities and local authorities. Other topics are likely to cover hydreological surveys, desalination and solarization. WASHCO training to be jointly undertaken after asset completion. Cost savings will be on printing materials, vehicle, and stationary. Joint mapping of WASH facilities in El-Afweyn and Ainabo to assess status of available assets, beneficiaries reached and to analyze gaps and investments necessary to provide support. .A joint MampE exercise will be done twice in the project period.",

The SHF activities will complement the CERF emergency health and nutrition activities in the selected locations. The proposed project will also complement DRC's drought-targeted Integrated Emergency Responses in Somalia funded by OFDA. This will enable DRC to provide a complete assistance package to the drought affected communities in selected locations in the North-Western part of Somaliland. The region selected is Awdal which is the most affected region in the north by drought and the Tripical Cyclone Sagar in June 2018, causing displacement and also affecting the strategic water points that communities rely on during the dry spells. Therefore, the WASH assistance package will include - rehabilitation and/or extension of existing water infrastructures construction of new water infrastructures equipping of boreholes with a hybrid pumping system (solar and generator) and distribution networks establishment of water committee to manage water points and ensure their sustainability. Where appropriate, DRC will partner with private borehole owners to supply water to catchment population and sign a tripartite MOU among the private borehole owner, DRC and Local Authorities. Where there are pressing needs especially in crowded IDP camps and among very vulnerable households, DRC will provide household-shared desludgable latrines. The latrines shall be shared among four (4) households. They shall be installed with hand-wash facility, a ramp to allow for easy access for PLDs especially the ones using a wheelchair and shall be installed with a door lockable from inside to ensure women feel secure while using them. DRC is equally piloting sanitation marketing in the south (Dollow and Baidoa), and will apply lessons learnt from these locations to this project. Overall, with rehabilitation of 5 boreholes,construction of 8 elevated tanks and installation of  portable water tanks DRC targets to reach 59,230 people of which 13623 men, 15400 women, 15400 boys and 14807 girls. This population includes 30% IDPs, 60% host community and 10% returnees. The other groups targeted include people affected by cyclone in Awdal considered the coastal population. With 200 desludgable latrines installed with hand wash facilities and sanitation kits, DRC will also reach 4800 people (1104 men, 1248 women, 1248 boys and 1200 girls) with sustainable access to adequate sanitation facilities.",

        "description": "This project aims at providing reliable and sustained access to safe water and adequate sanitation facilities to target population residing in nine riverine villages in Jowhar district that are facing water shortages and have limited access to sanitation facilities. The target population was heavily affected by floods that occurred in 2018 where water supply infrastructures and sanitation facilities were severely damaged and are yet to be repaired. Poor rainfall received during the 2018 Deyr season and the ongoing dry conditions has resulted in critical water shortages and a rapid decline in the remaining water reservoirs in Jowhar district. The river Shabelle that is the main source of water and a vital source of livelihood for communities residing along the river has dried up once again in now four consecutive years.\n\nIn this context, WOCCA will implement a WASH cluster-specific intervention aimed at providing sustained access to safe water through the rehabilitation of 22 strategic wells and fitted with hand pumps. To reduce pressure on the few functioning wells 2 shallow wells will be constructed in Bardheere and Nuukay village. A water distribution system that will include pipeline extension, overhead tank and water kiosk with 8taps and a solar pumping system will be installed in Nuukay village so that more people including neighboring pastoral communities can benefit from the water since the well has a good yield. In Gashaanle village rehabilitation of a shallow well, water tank, kiosk, and installation of a solar pumping system will be done. Identification of these targeted locations for construction and rehabilitation was done in consultation with the community elders and the local authority. The water sources will be located 30m away from latrines to avoid contamination. Dewatering of the rehabilitated/constructed shallow wells and application of shock chlorination will be done to ensure that the water is safe for consumption. \n\nTo strengthen community ownership and ensure sustainability of WASH assets 130 Water management committee members (at least 40% of women) will be trained on operation, maintenance and safe water storage. The project staff and WMC members will be trained on DRR and protection mainstreaming. 310 gender-sensitive latrines with hand-washing facilities, raised to avoid flooding and fitted with locks from the inside to curb GBV will be constructed in the targeted villages. Women, girls and vulnerable groups will be consulted in siting and design of the WASH infrastructures to maximize safety, privacy and dignity. To ensure the WASH infrastructures endure future floods, WOCCA will incorporate DRR aspects in the design of the WASH infrastructures. Sensitization meetings will be held at the inception of the project with all project stakeholders including groups at risk of exclusion to inform them about the project objectives, scope, beneficiary selection criteria, and beneficiary entitlement and roles. Accountability to the affected population will be enhanced through the provision of a feedback hotline to beneficiaries where they can provide feedback and complaints. To ensure quality in the project outputs the project staff will continuously monitor and report on project indicators. WOCCA will also share GPS coordinates of all WASH structures and monthly project reports with the WASH cluster and donor. Signing off and handing over of WASH structures to beneficiaries upon completion will be done through community elders, government officials and religious leaders. WOCCA will also adhere to the principles of \"Do no harm\" through not creating any partial, nepotism, conflict-oriented and sensitive issues within the project beneficiaries.",

Hygiene promotion activities will be complemented with our ongoing IERT project in Bay region. SAMA rapid assessment conducted between 5-6 March 2019 indicated that more than 75% of affected population can't afford the cost of water due to increased price of water exposing thousands of households to walk more than 30 minutes for water collection and become exposed and risk for gender-based violence. 80% of water infrastructure (wells) need are open source and expose to contamination which is risk of AWD diseases. to Takcle this , SAMA proposes sustainable solution to improve access to safe  water and sanitation services for the affected people in line with Somali WASH cluster response plan  : \n1. Water :  Provision of sustained access to safe drinking water to 17500 drought/AWD affected communities (2625 men,  4375 women,  5250 girls and 5250 boys) IDPs and poor host communities in Qansaxdhera district in Bay region, through rehabilitation of two boreholes equipped with hybrid and supplied water to two kiosks through piping system to two kiosks.  Upgrading /rehabilitation of of 11 shallow wells with hand pumps. To ensure the sustainability and the management of water facilities SAMA will enhance the capacity of WASH committees to keep the maintenance and operation of the water source after the project is faced out. \n2. Sanitation : SAMA will Increase access to sanitation facilities to the population affected by drought and AWD/cholera diseases through construction of 102 gender separated, flood proof latrines with lockable doors and hand washing facilities benefiting  affected people including women, men, girls and boys. SAMA will ensure the maintenance and the appropriate use of sanitation facilities in close coordination and collaboration with IDPs mainly camp committees (men and women). \n3. Adoption of good sanitation and promotion of public health : Sanitation/hygiene promotion activities will be complemented with our ongoing IERT poject in Bay region. 25 community health workers are carrying out comprehensive sanitation promotion through conducting cleaning up campaigns at 5 big IDP camps, awareness campaign to promote the adaption of good hygiene and sanitation practices to affected men, women and children.\nSAMA will ensure both quantity and quality of water (safety) for the affected population. No bacterial contamination and facilities remain functional in case of flooding.",

        "description": "As Water shortage and poor access to water currently remains the single biggest threat to lives of IDP\u2019s and vulnerable host communities in Hobyo and Galkacyo districts. Humanitarian needs have increased drastically due to below-average Deyr rain in 2018, large-scale displacement and lack of access to basic services. There are no permanent water sources within the IDP settlements hence IDPs rely on berkards which have since dried up, and there is high pressure on the few existing boreholes, already suffering years of neglect and poor maintenance in Hobyo and Galkacyo districts. Pastoralists are highly vulnerable because they are dependent upon rain-fed rangeland grazing for their livestock and tend to have very few fixed assets. The project intends to provide durable and sustainable water and sanitation services to 22,705 IDP\u2019s and drought vulnerable people in Afgaduudle, Madaxdaran, Lascadalle, Tarogee, Qaidaro and Wisil villages by drilling 3 boreholes and rehabilitation of 3 strategic boreholes to provide sufficient safe water increasing access to at least 15 litters per day. The boreholes will be piped within a radius of 1150 meters. The project will also construct 60 latrines to improve sanitation conditions. Construction amp rehabilitation of reliable water sources to the IDP\u2019s and vulnerable host communities will reduce distance and time spent collecting water thus contribute to reduction of AWD for children and GBV among women and girls. WASH committees will also be established/revived/streamlined and trained to strengthen their capacity to manage the operation and maintenance of the new and rehabilitated boreholes and promote good hygiene practices and sanitation within their communities. 60 participants (30% are women) from NGO\u2019s, government and private sector will be selected in mutual collaboration with National and Regional WASH cluster will be trained on diagnostics of ageing boreholes and methods of rehabilitation through 2 workshops in Galkacyo and Mogadishu.",

Education specific activities will include the provision of education supplies, emergency take-away food rations for students to meet their food and energy needs and emergency teacher incentives to motivate teachers to stay in the schools. Specific WASH activities will include increasing schools\u2019 water storage capacity through the provision of PVC storage tanks, the construction and rehabilitation of latrines, and improving hygiene practices among children through engagement with school hygiene promoters. As hygiene promoters will interact closely with students during hygiene promotion sessions and recreational activities, CISP will train this cadre on hygiene promotion, psycho-social support (PSS), and child protection and safeguarding. Specific Protection activities will include the mapping and sharing of existing child protection service providers and their respective services to school administrators and communities, strengthening child protection systems in schools, including the recruitment and training of child protection focal persons at each school, and awareness raising and training of community education committees (CEC) on child protection. CISP will also continue to engage with Ministry of Education Culture and Higher Education (MoECHE) and train cluster partners and MoE staffs on safe schools contingency planning, DRR and emergency response. CISP will provide training to CECs on their roles and responsibilities, food and water management, disaster risk reduction (DRR), civic skills, proposal development, and child protection in the respective schools. To ensure water availability in targeted schools, CISP will provide cash grants to CECs. In return, CECs will contribute in-kind or cash to procure safe water and manage its distribution to students. Further, the CECs will be trained on DRR to build their capacity and improve school preparedness against armed attack and other natural disasters. Disability and gender-friendly latrines in the targeted schools will be rehabilitated or, where necessary, constructed to minimize disruptions in learning for girls and boys. CISP will coordinate enrollment drives through MoE and with CECs and religious leaders to encourage school enrollment with an emphasis on children affected by displacement. CISP education department will utilize the existing synergies with CISP protection department to assess the existing child protection mechanisms at the start of the project, and, as determined from the assessment results, targeted schools will develop appropriate action plans to address areas of concern. To measure the effectiveness of the child protections systems implemented and capture lessons learned, CISP will conduct an end line assessment. Through the CISP protection department engagement with CEC\u2019s and the regional Gender Focal Points (GFP\u2019s) of MoE, CISP will leverage the agency's apparatus and community assets to raise awareness among children on child protection and the established mechanisms which will serve to strengthen child protection in schools.",

RRP will work towards reduction of the high prevalence of SAM and MAM in the district. hence reducing mortality and morbidity rates related to malnutrition and improve, provide and integrated, nutrition related resilience interventions lifesaving and quality nutrition services to acutely malnourished children and PLWs through community based nutritional service. Increase access and utilization of BNSP, MCH services to acutely malnourished boys\u2019 girls U5, and PLW and integrate WASH services. Capacity building to the community health workers, volunteers, care givers and field staff and strengthen the existing community-based nutrition service structures to provide comprehensive basic nutritional service packages (BNSP) to malnourished children U5 and PLW in the two districts. The lack of essential WASH services means serious public health risks and preventable deaths. \nThe project shall promote the equitable participation of both men and women in the planning and decision-making processes, this will ultimately help to ensure that the entire affected population has safe and easy access to water supply, sanitation facilities and services, and that such services and facilities are appropriate. The main objective of this intervention is to provide safe drinking water and even to improve on the sanitation aspect of the residence in the target districts. We also intent to reduce the transmission of and exposure to water borne diseases (AWD/cholera) among targeted at risk and vulnerable IDP populations. This shall be achieved through the provision of access to safe water, adequate and appropriate sanitation facilities and services. The project also aims to ensure that the targeted communities are sensitized, mobilized on best practices to prevent water and sanitation related diseases (AWD/cholera). All will be offered at community and facility level to reach all.",

        "description": "This project is designed to provide emergency and lifesaving nutrition services to 21984 vulnerable persons (3936 men, 5204 women, 5474 boys and 7370 girls) living in Balcad, cadale and Mahaday districts of Middle Shabelle. The intervention will target pregnant and lactating women (PLW) together with children under the age of 5 years (CU5) amongst the host communities, IDPs and returnees in the Balcad district where Wocca is the primary rationalized partner in Adale where we are the secondary rationalized partner and also extend our services to Mahaday.  Wocca will operate 2 fixed/static outpatient therapeutic feeding centers (fixed OTPs) and 4 mobile outpatient therapeutic feeding programme teams (mobile OTPs) targeting 16 locations chosen on the basis of vulnerability and absence of nutrition interventions in the 3 districts. The static facilities will be established in Ceelow and Caddow Uul locations  and Cadale districts respectively while the 4 outreach teams will serve 14 locations namely Bulo Axmed Cigow, Kulmis Weyn, Buurfuule and Xudur Ciise in Mahaday Ceelka Cusub, Cisiley and Sheikh Rooble Garas weyne, Cadan gabey and Ceel Xamar in Cadale Xanlay, Muki dheere Bari, Bulo Walaal and Caro faag in Balcad. WOCCA has engaged UNICEF for backstopping during training of the project staff, community health workers (CHWs) and mothers for the \u201cmothers MUAC approach\u201d, on nutrition screening and case identification, Integrated management of acute malnutrition(IMAM),Infant and young child feeding education (IYCF-E) and Nutrition, health and hygiene promotion (NHHP).The trained staff shall be deployed to the targeted locations, mobile and static OTPs where together with the trained mothers will screen children under 5 and PLWs. Children under 5 with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) conditions and no medical complications will be enrolled to the static and mobile OTPs for treatment while the cases with medical complications will be referred by the mobile clinics and CHWs to the stabilization center (SC) in Waberi star village managed by WOCCA for nutrition and medical rehabilitation. Children under 5 and PLWs with MAM conditions will be referred to TSFP center managed by ARC. CHWs and Hygiene promoters will be trained on Nutrition, Health and Hygiene Promotion (NHHP), they will disseminate hygiene promotion messages to the communities to prevent outbreak and spread of communicable diseases like AWD/cholera during the activities as they move around with the mobile Team. Mothers will be counseled individually and in groups by trained nutrition staff and Community Health Workers (CHWs) on appropriate maternal infant and young child feeding as part of efforts to prevent malnutrition. The project will also provide micronutrient support by distributing multiple micronutrients (MNPs) and Vitamin A supplements to pregnant and lactating women and children under the age of 5years through the static and mobile facilities. UNICEF has been supporting WOCCA with nutrition supplies and technical guidance on previous nutrition projects within the targeted locations and currently supporting our SHF funded project running in Daynille/Kaxda IDP camps and in Balcad district. Therefore, in this project WOCCA will still engage UNICEF to provide nutrition supplies and technical support for management of SAM cases. To enhance effective coordination, WOCCA will provide monthly activity updates with partners including Nutrition cluster both regional and Nairobi level, Other agencies working in the field who are doing other sector projects in the project sites will also be updated to avoid duplication and promote effective and efficient utilization humanitarian fund.",

        "description": "Somalia\u2019s population is currently experiencing multiple shocks (\u2018triple threat\u2019 \u2013 locust, drought, COVID-19): the Desert Locust upsurge that started in late 2019  and continues to threaten the food security and livelihoods of pastoralists and farmers in many parts of the country; riverine and flash floods that affect the food security, livelihoods and safety of farmers and people living in flood-prone, populated areas; the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic that is having severe health and socio-economic impacts both in Somalia and globally; and the extended impact of previous shocks (flooding, drought, displacement, etc.) on livelihoods.\nAssessments by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), Food Security and Nutrition Analysis Unit (FSNAU) and Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWSNET) also indicate that, in the absence of humanitarian assistance, up to 2.1 million people across Somalia are expected to face food consumption gaps or depletion of assets indicative of Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or worse outcomes through December 2020.In addition, 849 900 children under the age of five are likely to be acutely malnourished through August 2021 . Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are expected from June to September in parts of central Somalia, where livestock holdings are lowest, and in northeasternSomalia, where the economy is more dependent on livestock, seafood, and frankincense exports. The socioeconomic impacts of COVID-19have led to a 30-50 % decline in annual external remittances, an anticipated 25-35 % decline in annual livestock exports, lower labour demand, and above average imported staple food prices.\nBesides adverse weather conditions and conflict resulting in food insecurity and hunger, other prevailing challenges in the project areas Oxfam and partners Candlelight, Havoyoco and KAALO work are poor access to water and inadequate hygiene and sanitation conditions, as well as displacement. Against this backdrop,  the proposed activities aim at assisting both IDPs and host communities. Access to clean and safe water is a major area of concern in our intervention areas in Somaliland and Puntland.\nOur proposed activities focus on relieving the distress suffered by affected families, preventing their situation from getting worse and strengthening collective resilience mechanisms. In terms of sectors we will focus on Food Security <(>&<)> Livelihoods (FSL), Water, Sanitation <(>&<)> Hygiene (WASH), Protection (PRO), Multi-Purpose Cash (MPCT) and Accountability (ACC).\nOxfam and partners Candlelight, Havoyoco and KAALO will work in the following regions and districts/locations: Awdal (Baki), Sool (Las Anod, Xudun, Bocaame), Sanaag (Eerigavo), Bari (Bossaso), Mudug (Jariiban). Partners have been implementing SOMJR activities in these regions and locations since 2019 (Awdal, Sool, Sanaag) and 2020 (Bari, Mudug), and were able to invest in the resilience building of target communities. Bocaame in Sool has been added as a new location to the SOMJR: it has already been targeted by partner KAALO during the DRA-funded Desert Locust Joint Response (May to October 2020), however, needs remain high as Bocaame is highly affected by insecurity and recurring waves of desert locust invasions.",

        "description": "Somalia\u2019s population is currently experiencing multiple shocks (\u2018triple threat\u2019 \u2013 locust, drought, COVID-19): the Desert Locust upsurge that started in late 2019  and continues to threaten the food security and livelihoods of pastoralists and farmers in many parts of the country; riverine and flash floods that affect the food security, livelihoods and safety of farmers and people living in flood-prone, populated areas; the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic that is having severe health and socio-economic impacts both in Somalia and globally; and the extended impact of previous shocks (flooding, drought, displacement, etc.) on livelihoods.\nAssessments by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), Food Security and Nutrition Analysis Unit (FSNAU) and Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWSNET) also indicate that, in the absence of humanitarian assistance, up to 2.1 million people across Somalia are expected to face food consumption gaps or depletion of assets indicative of Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or worse outcomes through December 2020.In addition, 849 900 children under the age of five are likely to be acutely malnourished through August 2021 . Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are expected from June to September in parts of central Somalia, where livestock holdings are lowest, and in northeasternSomalia, where the economy is more dependent on livestock, seafood, and frankincense exports. The socioeconomic impacts of COVID-19have led to a 30-50 % decline in annual external remittances, an anticipated 25-35 % decline in annual livestock exports, lower labour demand, and above average imported staple food prices.\nBesides adverse weather conditions and conflict resulting in food insecurity and hunger, other prevailing challenges in the project areas Oxfam and partners Candlelight, Havoyoco and KAALO work are poor access to water and inadequate hygiene and sanitation conditions, as well as displacement. Against this backdrop,  the proposed activities aim at assisting both IDPs and host communities. Access to clean and safe water is a major area of concern in our intervention areas in Somaliland and Puntland.\nOur proposed activities focus on relieving the distress suffered by affected families, preventing their situation from getting worse and strengthening collective resilience mechanisms. In terms of sectors we will focus on Food Security <(>&<)> Livelihoods (FSL), Water, Sanitation <(>&<)> Hygiene (WASH), Protection (PRO), Multi-Purpose Cash (MPCT) and Accountability (ACC).\nOxfam and partners Candlelight, Havoyoco and KAALO will work in the following regions and districts/locations: Awdal (Baki), Sool (Las Anod, Xudun, Bocaame), Sanaag (Eerigavo), Bari (Bossaso), Mudug (Jariiban). Partners have been implementing SOMJR activities in these regions and locations since 2019 (Awdal, Sool, Sanaag) and 2020 (Bari, Mudug), and were able to invest in the resilience building of target communities. Bocaame in Sool has been added as a new location to the SOMJR: it has already been targeted by partner KAALO during the DRA-funded Desert Locust Joint Response (May to October 2020), however, needs remain high as Bocaame is highly affected by insecurity and recurring waves of desert locust invasions.",

Project activities include: (1) responding to immediate food needs of specific beneficiaries, especially women and children; (2) restoring livelihoods; (3) protecting assets; and (4) preventing negative coping behaviors that contribute to food insecurity.

        "description": "Evictions represent a unique protection challenge in Somalia with far-reaching consequences on physical security, dignity, and livelihood of victims. Bossosa is one of the epicenters of the problem as the region struggles to recover from the residual effects of the 2016-17 drought amid persistent insecurity, cyclic natural disasters, and widespread unlawful evictions. At the national level, Somalia is faced with the daunting prospect of rebuilding the country having been riven by more than two decades of conflict and lawlessness. Important strides are being made to address the issue but ongoing initiatives have been outmatched due to the prevalence of the problem, thus necessitating a more robust, integrated and coordinated program response. In the absence of an effective response to address protection challenges that are being exacerbated by eviction, displaced communities will remain at risk of continuing secondary displacements. Efforts to strengthen protection and contribute to durable solutions to displacement in Bossaso will be incomplete and/or undermined without addressing the issue of eviction concurrently and systematically. The project seeks to contribute towards ensuring that individuals affected by displacement receive support assistance to improve their tenure security situation and address post-eviction complications.\n\nThis action builds on NRC\u2019s hands on expertise in evictions prevention and response programming in Somalia, and targeting 37,198 individuals in Bossaso, the project seeks to enhance the protection of displaced communities at risk of eviction and to create an enabling environment for sustained recovery and the pursuit of log lasting solutions. This overarching objective will be achieved by implementing a combination of complementary activities aimed at reducing the practice of unlawful evictions, strengthening tenure security among displaced communities at highest risk of eviction, and consolidating the protection of HLP rights. Priority actions include supporting the establishment of dedicated evictions prevention capacities at the municipality of Bossaso, replicating eviction programming best practices at the municipality, helping victims cope with post-eviction stress through cash, and strengthening local dispute resolution capacities and fostering social cohesion in target communities. A parallel objective of the HLP Sub Cluster which this project will seek to advance is consolidating HLP capacity among national organization.\n\nA combination of deliverables will contribute toward the mitigation of protection risks exacerbated by evictions through integrated prevention and response initiatives ensuring that displaced communities have increased access to information and specialized services necessary to navigate administrative and procedural obstacles linked to the enjoyment and exercise of HLP rights and supporting local mechanisms to address HLP violations and contribute to social cohesion.",

        "description": "The proposed project will support three existing GBV one stop centers and three safe spaces in Sool to ensure sustained provision of GBV services for survivors and will also support referral pathways for service provision. This is a comprehensive Gender Based Violence (GBV) project that attacks the root causes of GBV in Emergencies through mitigating the risk of GBV occurring in IDP and within the host communities of Laas Caanood, Taleex and Dharkein ganyo and provides multi-sectorial services to survivors of GBV through community based programming and strengthening of GBV response systems and promoting community cohesiveness which will promote community-based protection mechanism by ensuring women, men, girls and boys participate in community-based protection mechanisms/sessions. The primary modalities for delivering service will be through the scaling up of direct service provision to GBV survivors using integrated referral pathways for clinical management of rape, service mobilization through women and girls\u2019 safe spaces. Some of the key activities include: Improving access to rape services for GBV survivors Providing comprehensive services including GBV case management, legal aid, psychological first aid/support accompanied with referral for appropriate services capacity building of actors, medical support, facilitate access to legal services through referrals, provision of dignity kits and solar lanterns, access to psycho-social support through counseling to GBV survivors, facilitate referral to ensure access to appropriate services. This approach incorporated harmonized approach to access services through both preventive and response mechanism. The response measures shall enhance access to referral for medical support, access legal support by making referral to other partner organizations, access to dignity kits to the survivors and also to women and girls at risk of GBV, solar lanterns and psycho social support. This shall therefore increase accessibility to quality and coordinated GBV services for conflict affected communities in Laas Caanood, Taleex and Dharkein Ganyo and strengths resilience among the vulnerable populations including Internal Displaced Population (IDPs) and poor host community through awareness. TASS will also undertake a comprehensive mapping of existing referral pathways for GBV survivors on how they can access to the services and challenges in remote target locations and maintain monitoring and reporting of GBV incidents for prevention and response actions. While implementing the activities we will work closely and use the existing structures to strengthen the coordination with stakeholders/clusters, partners and government structures and /or women and girls\u2019 friendly spaces and avenues. TASS shall ensure confidentiality in reporting and also referral mechanism through its qualified and professional staff who will improve services accessibility to women and girls in target locations and provide comprehensive services",

Moreover, this project will also focus on building the capacities of the IDP leadership and local actors to gradually take over the camp management responsibilities. \n\nNoFYL will conduct the basic care and maintenance of the camps in Daynille District and spontaneous settlements in the Afgooye District the upcoming care and maintenance phase presents a different range of challenges, requiring strong humanitarian leadership and very close engagement with the population to promote community ownership and empowerment, as well as the gradual transfer of responsibility for the care of the site infrastructure. NoFYL will continue to work regularly with IDP camp leadership and committees to strengthen collaboration and their participation in decision-making processes, while also striving to improve diversity in representation and gender balance in the governance structure. As NoFYL anticipates, new arrivals will continue to seek shelter within the sites and spontaneous settlements throughout the project period, NoFYL's Camp Management team will support this population with reception and conduct site verification monthly. The quarterly Site Verification exercise in Afgoye district will be conducted to provide multi-sector information on access and availability to basic services in the floods affected sites to ascertain gaps in service provision and monitor services being provided, the verification will be conducted by NoFYL's multi-functional mobile teams, this will help to produce detailed information on the population of each site, its perimeter, access and services available in sites. NoFYL will use this data and contribute to its dissemination in order to inform humanitarian response at each level.\n\nThis overarching objective will be achieved by enhancing the overall protective environment for flood-affected population, increasing access to basic services linked to different sectors, reducing the risk, and availing specialized support assistance to beneficiaries to help them address other interconnected protection concerns. The action is also conceptualized to consolidate the ongoing humanitarian response to the flood situation in the targeted locations. Through this grant, NoFYL will reach 1,550 HHs in 8 umbrella Camps (considering minimum 180 HHs per settlement) with a total target beneficiary of 12,400 in Daynille and  Afgooye districts with necessary services through a coordination mechanism set in place with relevant stakeholders and other partners.\n\nThis project will also be linked to this ongoing protection/HLP activities through monitoring, documentation, and reporting of threats to evictions by assessing potential eviction sites, preventing and responding to eviction. Capacity development targeting settlement managers, CMCs, and local authorities on Housing, Land, and proper protection monitoring through ensuring collection of information based on the methodology of the Somalia Protection Monitoring System (SPMS).",

The villages have either been affected by floods due to River Shabelle breaking its banks and flooding the settlements and farmlands in the riverine areas or flash floods sweeping the villages as a result of above-normal heavy Hagaa rains experienced in the region. The Guu rains expected between October and December are likely to result further deterioration of the situation.\nEducation facilities in the targeted villages are closed since most of them were affected either flood from river bank breakage that saw them completely inundated or marooned by water. \nThe villages are generally food insecure as the population is faced with acute unemployment, the prohibitive cost of living, and lack of skill sets by majority of the dwellers to eke meaningful living. The situation is further exacerbated by cyclic droughts and flash floods that are making agro-pastoralism lifestyle untenable and thus many are dropping out to join the ever-increasing population of vulnerable persons in the riverine regions. The worst affected are children and women who often bear the brunt of neglect and abandonment during these hard times. This often makes them susceptible to abuses and exploitations such as Gender-Based Violence, sexual exploitation, early marriages, child labor and recruitment to armed groups. \nThe project intends to use school attendance as an important preventive factor for child protection, particularly the girl-child. The project will employ such interventions as, training of teachers on basic child protection skills, provision of child-friendly environment through improvement and repair of damaged temporary/ permanent classrooms. Aid Vision will establish and strengthen the capacity of CtC clubs to provide peer interaction forums to learners, provision of teaching and learning materials-including recreational materials, capacity building of CBCPCs to raise awareness on risks of child abuse and enhance children\u2019s access and retention at schools. The CBCPCs will contribute to service mapping, identification of referral pathways and disseminate the information about available child protection service for children in the community. CP Focal Points, trained on PSS/PFA, will facilitate structured gender sensitive recreational and PSS activities at the schools for both boys and girls throughout the project live and conduct child safety walk and audit/ /risk mapping exercises with the guidance of project CP supervisor.\nTo address urgent WASH needs at the schools and ensure continuous learning for 2000 learners, Aid Vision will supply water to 7 schools for 6 months which will be delivered by trucks. Each school will have water storage tank with taps placed at strategic location for easy access. 23 twin gender-sensitive latrines will be constructed at schools that lack sanitation facilities. All latrines will have sufficient water, hand washing facilities and lockable doors for meaningful access. Girls and boys will attend CP awareness sessions to be organized for all schools. This is aimed at ensuring they have preventive skills on violence against children. Girls latrines usage will be monitored and corrective actions taken to address safety concerns. Regular hygiene promotion campaigns focusing on handwashing and safe water handling will be conducted at schools for 14 days to prevent the risk of AWD/Cholera outbreak. Hygiene promotion sessions will follow where schools\u2019 health clubs will disseminate messages on good hygiene practices at schools. To ensure schools have sustained access to water 2 shallow wells damaged by floods will be rehabilitated and protected with hand-pumps. 9 manually operated hand-free hand washing stations will be installed and soap for hand washing provided to reduce risk/transmission of COVID-19.",

        "description": "The floods have been triggered by heavy, above-average rainfall locally and in upstream areas in the Ethiopian highlands and have affected Gedo, Hiraan, Middle Juba, and Middle and Lower Shabelle regions. The situation has been exacerbated by weak river embankments and open riverbanks. The worst affected districts are Balcad, Jowhar, and Mahaday in Middle Shabelle (Hirshabelle) Afgooye and Wanlaweyn districts in Lower Shabelle (South West State), and Belet Weyne (Hiraan) where over 85 percent of the displacement has occurred. Somalia\u2019s marginalized communities and internally displaced persons are expected to most severely be affected by the impact of the floods. An estimated 132,000 hectares (ha) of agricultural land and 294 villages along the Shabelle River have been affected by the Hagaa floods. New displacements and further disruption to livelihoods are expected as foreseen moderate to heavy rainfall in the Ethiopian highlands are likely to raise Shabelle River levels over the coming weeks, likely resulting in additional flooding in the middle and lower reaches of the Shabelle. Of particular concern is Jowhar town and its environs in Middle Shabelle, where the river level is near the full crest, and other riverine towns in the Lower Shabelle region. Thus, in this project ZAMZAM foundation aims to extend immediate support to the flood-affected most vulnerable men, women, and children including disabilities and marginalized communities and IDPs in Jowhar district through immediate support to food access, protect their livelihoods, support local food production, and prevent the adoption of crisis strategies. In order to reach the objective of the project ZAMZAM will carry the following activities: \n(1) Increase access to food and improve nutrition through Unconditional cash transfer to 555 HHS representing 3,330 most vulnerable groups of the community in Jowhar district including widows, women head HH, families with disabilities, or with severe prolonged illness, and isolated families without external support. The supporting period will be 3 months and the rate is 60% of Minimum Expenditure Basket (MEB) which corresponding to 60 USD. (2) Restore the livelihood to 2,310 flood-affected vulnerable farmers through the distribution of agricultural input, to start their farming activities, protect their livelihoods, support local food production, and prevent adaption of crisis strategies. The selection criteria of the project beneficiaries will be: (1) Women headed households, (2) households with disabilities, (3) households with malnourished children and women (4) poor households, and (5) households with farming lands. \nDuring the selection of the beneficiaries, ZAMZAM will consult with the line ministry, district local authority, community leaders, women groups, disabled people, marginalized communities, and religious groups, in order to make the selection fair, transparency, and accountability.\n\n(3) To keep the sustainability of the project and increase the production of the beneficiaries, ZAMZAM will train selected 200 lead farmers to share equally men and women from the target farmers on the best technologies and methodologies to increase their livelihoods production.\n\nThe project will seek to increase food supply, reduce hunger, counter rising food prices, and improve responses to food emergency crisis by extending the area of land cultivated under good agricultural practices. The project will use a similar approach to improve the use of adapted varieties, early planting, correct sowing, use of soil enhancing plant species, observing rotations, precision fertilizer placement and timely application, correct spacing, timely weeding, and post-harvest storage.",

        "description": "As part of the global capacity support to the FGS in its fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, the UN Resident Coordinator/Humanitarian Coordinator (RC/HC) has received a request from the Office of the Prime Minister (OPM) to provide two 350 KVA generators in strengthening the functioning of the De Martino and Benadir Hospitals and the National Testing Laboratory. The appeal to the United Nations for support is a matter of urgency as those two referral facilities are facing a dire need to keep power stability while treating and testing patients with COVID-19.  \nThe RC/HC has decided to use the Humanitarian response funds to finance the support and requested UNDP to handle the procurement process to provide the generators. From the quotations already sought by the OPM, the estimate cost for the two generators is USD 160,000 including delivery and installation. UNDP is currently launching its own competitive sourcing to come up with financial proposals for contracting the supplier with the best value for money. Before a contract is signed, a budget should be available in Atlas, hence this submission in GMS to secure funding.",

With an increase in Gender Based Violence following flooding in Beledweyne and Afgooye, there is an urgent need to improve access to quality multi-sectorial support for survivors and enhance community based protection mechanisms.  \nTo address this, RI will run two Women and Girl Safe Spaces (WGSS) in Beletwyne and Afgooye. One of the WGSS will be static located within a health facility in Afgooye and the other WGSS in Beletwyne will be mobile in nature and linked to one of RI supported static WGSSs at the health facilities for referrals and further support of the survivors. RI is running 4 static WGSS in Beletwyne with support of UNFPA. The Mobile WGSS will be able to reach out to higher grounds where communities have relocated yet cannot access the static WGSS facilities. Approximately 400 women and girls will be reached with advocacy, PSS, referral, case management and material support. \nBoth static and Mobile WGSS will be staffed with female and male GBV staff, CHWs and medical staff who will provide GBV response and services to targeted communities. While the medical team will be responding to offering GBV related medical treatment, the GBV staff will run both men and women sessions separately while the CHWs will be conducting door to door GBV awareness and provide avenues for safe reporting of GBV and referrals to Mobile unit team for medical, PSS and case management. WGSS staff will provide survivor centred case management through PFA, medical treatment and facilitating referrals for other services. In addition, the WGGS will serve as a place where women and men meet weekly to get information on GBV prevention and response and establish social support groups where they share and learn from each other. The WGSS are designed with the specific needs of women and girls to have the space they need to be able to voice their concerns and needs in regards to issues that affect them personally.\nRI will update and strengthen already existing linkages with other GBV service providers for referral purposes and to ensure survivors and those at risk are able to access quality multi-sectoral services as needed with RI providing support and follow-up on all cases. RI will work with community health workers to ensure they have the necessary skills and understanding to identify GBV cases and make appropriate referrals. \nTo enhance community-based protection mechanisms, RI will work with all members of communities, including both IDPs and Host Community members women, men, boys and girls, and community/ religious leaders. Activities will include awareness campaigns, advocacy platforms, community protection audits and trainings. \nThe project is expected to reach 5,989 direct beneficiaries (3,929 female and 2,060 male) and 93, 545 indirect beneficiaries.

Approximately 150 GBV survivors will be supported to access survivor centered multi-sectorial response and material support. A total of 25 religious leaders will be engaged in GBV advocacy and 14 (9 female) clinical and non-clinical staff will be trained on GBV response including Clinical Management of Rape (CMR), Psychological First Aid (PFA), and Psychosocial Support (PSS) and GBV Case management.

The project will be implemented in two districts in Middle Shabelle region (Balcad and Jowhar)\n\nThe main objective of the proposed integrated protection project is to improve the protection of the targeted children, girls and women from abuse, violence and exploitation in the target area. The  integrated protection emergency response  is designed to improve the protection of the target children, girls and women from abuse, violence and exploitation through provision of psychosocial and mental health support  and provide rapid identification, tracing and family reunification services for those at risk of family separations. In addition to this, unaccompanied and separated children in the intervention targeted IDPs will be reunified with their caregivers/guardians and those children who do not have caregivers/guardians will be supported through community based (clan/kafala) foster care placements.  Through existing Community Protection Committees (CPC), provide a platform to establish community\u00ac based child protection mechanisms (CBCPMs) to facilitate the identification of and response to child protection concerns, the development of community\u00ac based mitigation plans, prevention messaging (e.g. on forced recruitment) and child protection surveillance mechanisms. \n\nThe project propose to create CFS at community level that will provide psychosocial and recreational support through structured and age appropriate group and individual activities including recreation, skill building and basic learning activities. The proposed CFS will also provide children with a protective and conducive environment to play socialize and learn to express themselves.  In addition, the project will provide psychosocial and parenting activities to both IDPS and host communities and their caregivers. The project will provide community-based PSS and resilience activities aimed towards coping and strengthening protective environment for children and their parents. Child right groups will be established at community level and provide psychosocial support (PSS) workshops (MHPSS) services to key targeted beneficiaries in view of increasing child resilience in IDP and surrounding communities. This will be conducted in the CFS centers at the community level.\nThe project will also carry out community based mapping to identify safety risk for children and provide  insight into what issues exist and better understanding of how issues connect to each other and plan for mitigation to support the identified risk.\n\nThe project is also designed to increase women and adolescent girls access to life saving prevention and response measures through providing GBV services, case management, PSS counselling to traumatized GBV survivors to reduce risk of GBV at target districts.  To provide timely, effective and efficient GBV responses, the proposed project will train health workers and caseworkers in CM and CMR of rape survivors.  Community based GBV volunteers will be trained to conduct GBV services awareness campaign. This will offer an opportunity to provide much needed response services in the target areas that are without GBV and protection services.  \n\nFinally the intervention will also provide child protection awareness creation on COVID 19 and adopt WHO and CP AoR approved IEC risk communication and print it in local language as well general awareness child protection prevention messages.",

Risk education activities implemented as part of the project will seek to reduce the risk of death and injury EO by raising awareness and promoting safe behavior. Most at-risk communities will be identified and reached through life-saving messages tailored to specific groups. \nTargeted communities will be better equipped to identify the threat and adopt safe behaviors, such as sharing information among their communities and reporting any suspicious items to the Somali authorities. To promote the sustainability of the project, MAG will build the capacity of local partners through the training of community liaison officers (CLOs) from JUMAN and the continuous monitoring, evaluation, and feedback of the activities implemented. This will enable them to continue delivering risk education messages, once the project is completed. Also, it will strengthen their position as key points to collect reports from the community and consolidate information related to EO contamination for future use of HMA stakeholders and Somali authorities. The effectiveness and scope of the intervention will be greatly improved by local partners with field teams who are familiar with the context.  \nOn measuring the impact, MAG expects to find based on previous data that over 70% of EORE recipients demonstrated improved knowledge and practices with regards to their recognition of and behavior around EO, while 70% of EORE recipients indicate they feel safer following the intervention. This methodology of conveying   EORE, the project will allow similar baseline figures to be collected with regards to the effectiveness of awareness risk education and used for future planning.\n\nAccording to the protection cluster (Abor Indicators for HNO Sept 2020), about 2,228,463    EO people are categorized as persons in need (PIN) for the explosive hazards awareness sensitization in the Banadir region where the project is targeting leveling them as severity phase 3 of which 497,000 are among the those displaced by the floods while 1,731,463    EO is the host communities in various districts within Banadir region. There were more than 5 accidents with fatalities and casualties in the Danyiile district alone this year which includes children and persons with no knowledge of Explosive ordinances.\n\nIn Afgooye about 191,143 persons standing as 100% of the population severity level no 3 described as degrading which puts them highly in need of protection against the explosive substances. Of these 56,000 are IDPs from the floods and other natural calamities while 135,431 are host communities according to the data recently shared by the protection cluster on HNO.\n\nExplosive ordinances contamination presents a barrier to development, and encumber livelihood activities particularly it affected IDPs, returnees, animal herders, and the rural poor families.",

These areas are currently concerned by displacement and voluntary return movements and, with the intensification of the military operations around AS control areas, it is expected that a high number of newly displaced people and/or newly accessible people will be imminently in need of critical assistance. Further to this, recent wave of flooding affected a significant segment of the population in Jubaland and several parts of South Central, including Kismayo and Belet Weyne in Hirshabelle. In addition to physical destruction, communities lost HLP assets and are now being confronted with the daunting prospect of either recovering abandoned assets or engaging in recovery initiatives that would help to develop or re-acquire such assets. As part of the response framework, the project will provide populations falling into such categories with specialised support assistance to help them overcome legal obstacles central to the protection, exercise and enjoyment of their HLP rights. The project also seeks to develop adequate HLP capacity within these communities, to co-exist peacefully and be protected from unlawful evictions, and to help stakeholders better understand the extent of the damage to HLP assets as well as alternatives to addressing the problem. The project will also conduct HLP assessments by mapping damaged HLP assets and the implication of the damage to protection outcomes and the enjoyment of rights. NoFYL will also undertake Post flood eviction response, prevention initiatives, negotiations and monitoring and reporting. HLP Legal aid service provision will also be supported through the project.\n\n\nThe overarching objective is to monitor and report on protection risks, human rights violations and gaps in available service, are identified and addressed through protection monitoring and analysis.\n\nTo achieve the expected outcome NoFYL will through its skilled and highly trained monitors will collect accurate data/information on displacement and protection incident necessary to inform responsive and strategically targeted humanitarian response in the target locations. The expected outcome will also be achieved through enhancing access to emergency protection assistance for populations victimised by serious protection incidents through referral to specialised support services, include psycho social and clinical support by specialized case workers and nurses. \n\nThe project will have the following outcomes.\n\n1.\tIncreased availability of information necessary to inform responsive and strategically targeted humanitarian response in Kismayo amp Balcad.\n2.\tEnhanced access to emergency protection assistance for populations victimized by serious protection incidents including provision of emergency protection assistance and referrals for specialized care.\n3.\tJoint multi-sectoral assessments facilitated including eviction monitoring, post-return monitoring, service mapping, protection incident monitoring, ongoing rapid assessments on flood damage assessments, and alert reporting.\n4. \u2018   Communities supported to recover from the impact of flood.\n5.

Beneficiaries will be provided with cash ($100 per each HH in single installment) for NFIs while $145 (80% or $116 as the first installment and remaining 20% or $29 as the second installment) per HH will be provided for Emergency Shelter Kits. In order to enable a holistic response and deliver greater impact, each household will benefit from both the NFIs and ESKs provision. NRC will acquire the services of local telecom company Hormuud Telecom for the cash transfers and with this adhere to strict beneficiary verification protocols which in this case will also include beneficiary verification by the service provider through their mobile Identities before disbursement of the cash. This beneficiary list will include the names of the selected beneficiaries, mobile number, token numbers, location of residence and gender. It is only upon verification of the beneficiary details as submitted by NRC that the service provider shall disburse. Beneficiaries whose personal details are not approved will go through a second round of verification process. \n\n80% of the targeted beneficiaries will be IDPS while 20% will be host community members . A predetermined beneficiary selection criteria that considers the needs of Extremely Vulnerable Individuals (EVIs) including female and single-headed HHs, orphans, chronically ill, aged and child-headed households will be applied . These criteria will be refined further and agreed upon with community leaders at inception to ensure that only those that are in real need receive aid. Gender will be mainstreamed at each and every stage of the action with specific attention given to the multiple and diversified needs of women, men, boys and girls.

The villages are home to pastoralists and agrarian communities.  Other villages that are affected by the floods include Athale, Haji Ali, Mahaday, Sabuni, Congo, Grasweyn and Adow uul. According to OCHA updates 1 on Deyr Season Floods Update, as of 4 November 2020, the flood in Jowhar affected 27,364 person living in Jowhar .The update also reported that on 3rd and 4th November 2020, flash floods cut the road linking Jowhar to Mogadishu at a location 10 km south of Jowhar.  The floods also affected the road to the airport. On 12th and 13th October 2020, heavy rains triggered flash floods in the riverine villages affecting about 3,600 people.  The Jowhar authorities reported that two children drowned as the result of the flash floods.The floods caused various impact to the WASH facilities the findings indicate that only less than 10% of the total affected population have access to safe water drinking water. Most of the infrastructure such as latrines have submerged and destroyed as the result of the floods. Sanitation is a serious issue due to the inadequate number of latrines in comparison to the population in need and many people are practice open defecation due to lack of sufficient latrines against the population. Lack of adequate and safe sanitation puts women, girls and at risk of physical violence and sexual assault as they relieve themselves in the open field.The water have been contaminated and not fit for human consumption leading to potential outbreaks of water-borne diseases and acute water diarrhea.Therefore, in order to fill the gaps Islamic relief Somalia with funding from OCHA is planning to fill the gaps by rehabilitating of 5 shallow wells, two 2 boreholes and construction of 200 flood latrines.The project aims to tackle the effects emanating from the floods by providing emergency WASH services in Jowhar district, Somalia. The intervention is in line with the WASH strategy. It will also link to recovery and resilience building of the communities by rehabilitating WASH infrastructure that will assist 16,500 direct beneficiaries affected by Hagaa floods in Jowhar .The project will install solar power systems to the two (02) boreholes that are to be  rehabilitated  in jowhar depending on the needs while the rehabilitation of five (05) shallow wells will be undertaken at Mahaday,gumeysta,congo,marerey and cali warabey. The shallow wells will be rehabilitated, protected and upgrading including the installation of Two (2) boreholes that will be rehabilitated will be connected to water piping system including construction of four (4) water kiosk from the main borehole, gender balanced water management committees will be formed and trained.

The worst affected districts by floods are Balcad, Jowhar and Mahaday in Middle Shabelle (Hirshabelle) Afgooye and Wanlaweyn distr icts in Lower Shabelle (South West State) and Belet Weyne (Hiraan) where over 85 per cent of the displacement has occurred. The flooding situation in Balcad district has resulted in massive displacement affecting particularly children, mothers and the elderly who are now facing serious hunger, health and protection risks in an area already receiving little to no humanitarian assistance due to insecurity. The floods have destroyed food reserves and threatened food markets. Significant gaps have been reported in flood-affected areas regarding to food, emergency shelter, non-food items, and safe drinking water, sanitation facilities and poor hygiene. Mothers, children, and the elderly as well as disabled people are extra affected due to the fact that displacement puts them at risk of exploitation since they lack their normal income routines and familiar environment. People are at a high risk of hunger and illness such as water-borne diseases which has already been reported in some of the flood affected areas. The impact of the ongoing flooding in Hirshabelle compounded by economic and social impacts of COVID-19 and forecast of below-average Gu rainfall from October to December 2020 may result in further deterioration of humanitarian outcomes for affected communities through 2021. The proposed project aims to save the lives of affected communities in Balcad district and enhance resilience building by provide safe, equitable and sustainable access to safe and sufficient water for drinking, cooking, personal, and domestic (15L/p/day) through by drilling and construction of 1 borehole and rehabilitation of 3 boreholes and 5 shallow wells, construction of 100 flood proof latrines that consider the disable people, distribution of hygiene and sanitation kits to improve sanitation conditions and establishment and train water management committees to the operation and maintenance of the facilities. The project will target the most vulnerable households (men, women boys and girls) affected  differently by the ongoing floods but give special attention to female-headed households, the  elderly and people living with disability. Market-based programming (MBP) will be considered in all the activities to strengthen and working with existing markets supply chains and service providers in project target areas to meet the needs of crisis-affected populations.GSA has extensive experience of working in the WASH sector within Balcad district and can mobilize rapidly due to strong links with communities and government.",

The floods have been triggered by heavy, above-average rainfall locally and in upstream areas in the Ethiopian highlands and have affected Gedo, Hiraan, Middle Juba, and Middle and Lower Shabelle regions. The floods have been triggered by heavy, above-average rainfall locally and in upstream areas in the Ethiopian highlands and have affected Gedo, Hiraan, Middle Juba, and Middle and Lower Shabelle regions. The floods temporarily displaced households to higher grounds in several prone areas including Belet Weyne. The recurrent floods have inundated the roads, WASH infrastructures, crops, houses and etc. A cholera outbreak fueled by limited access to safe drinking water, poor sanitation, and displacement has already been reported in some of the flood-affected districts, underscoring the need for urgent repair and rehabilitation to damaged WASH infrastructure and the provision of clean water. More cases of acute watery diarrhea (AWD) are being reported in children under five years old, who are particularly vulnerable to disease, especially if their immune systems are compromised by malnutrition. Thus, in this project, AADSOM will improve access to safe water, sanitation facilities and promote good hygiene practices to reduce the negative impacts of the flood in the Belet Weyne town and 9 villages in Belet Weyne district to 19,000 women, men, boys, and girls including people with disabilities, minorities and most vulnerable underserved communities. Key activities AADSOM would like to undertake within this project the following WASH services:\nWater:\n- Provision of safe water to 1,000 households representing 6,000 men, women and children affected population through water vendors (water trucking) by using Water Voucher (WV) \n- Rehabilitation/construction of 29 flood-damaged shallow wells with hand pumps.\n- Establishment and capacity building training to gender-balanced 29 WASH committees and 58 Well Operators shared equally by men and women, to ensure continuity of service, operation, and maintenance, coupled training on DDR and conflict resolution mechanisms as cross-cutting\n\nHygiene and Sanitation:\nLack of access to adequate and appropriate sanitation and hygiene poses a serious threat to public health. The practice of open defecation is a leading cause of fecal-oral transmission of diseases with children being the most vulnerable. A safe and appropriate latrine accompanied by handwashing with soap provides an effective barrier to the transmission of diseases. The provision of appropriate facilities for defecation is also an essential response for people\u2019s dignity, safety, health, and well-being. To improve safe access to sanitation it is necessary to meet standards of privacy and safety of women and girls against GBV using sanitation structures that are locally or culturally acceptable. never the less, the disabilities will be given a special design that is appropriate and acceptable for use. in this project, AADSOM will: \n\n- Conduct comprehensive hygiene promotion campaigns to reach 19,000 men, women, boys, and girls through visiting house to house, schools, health centers, and feeding centers \n-Train 10 community hygiene promoters (5 men and 5 women), who will carry out hygiene promotion activities during and after the project is faced out \n-Distribute of 1,000 HP kits to 1,000 households with vulnerable men, women, and children, and\n- Construct 263 gender-sensitive and flood-proof latrines for the most affected community including latrines for disabled people in ensuring the sustainability of the latrines during floods.",

        "description": "Merka communities face scarcity of safe and sufficient water due to abnormal dryness and floods coupled with the effect of pandemic since march 2020. At this critical moment, vulnerable communities rely on unsafe water for drinking and domestic use, leading to increased health risks and poor living standards. Floods further undermine the sanitation services available in Merka and its environs. During the most recent floods in August 2020, over 60 percent of latrines were non-functional due to the floods leading to high rates of open defecation and increased incidences of water-borne diseases. To reverse the negative impact of recent natural hazards and increase the resilience of Merka IDP and host communities, a sustainable WASH intervention capable of withstanding these shocks and improving living standards is vital. ARD will respond to this compounded risk by implementing living saving WASH services in six largely underserved and high-WASH risk IDP sites in Merka, including Ceel xaaji, Ceel Ahmed ,Shalaamboot,Horseed and Ceel Jaale IDP sites, and will serve 3,000 households (18,000 individuals). The below proposed WASH activities are fully aligned with allocation strategy for flood response and as well as WASH cluster response strategy detailed in HRP 2020\nWater \nThrough water voucher assistance for a period of 60 days, provide safe drinking water to 1,300 flood affected families who have no access to clean water, or their water points are unsafe for drinking and needs disinfection and rehabilitation\nConstruction/rehabilitation 20 unprotected shallow wells installed with hand pumps. ARD will ensure the all rehabilitated wells will have infrastructures that can resist future floods. \nTo ensure the sustainability of rehabilitated water infrastructures, 20 WASH committees and 40 well operators will be trained on operation and management of water facilities.\nSanitation\nConstruction of 140 gender separated and desludgable flood proof latrines with lockable doors and handwashing facilities benefitting a total of 4,200 flood/AWD/cholera affected people. Around 7% (i.e. 10) of flood proof latrines will be allocated and designed for people living with disabilities (PWDS).\nCarry out environmental sanitation services to all project target locations especially IDP camps to improve all preventive measures against the risks of AWD/cholera outbreaks in Merka district, 4,500 people will benefit the environmental sanitation services by conducting mass clean-Up campaigns to manage solid waste in IDPs and host populated settlements. ARD will procure and distribute 60 sanitation tools to support the cleanup campaigns. \nHygiene\nUsing MBP/CVA modality, distribute 2,000 hygiene kits to reach 12,000 people affected by the floods or at risk of AWD/cholera in Merka district. The hygiene kit will constitute the following items: 200 aqua tabs, 1 Jerry can (20l Capacity), 1 bucket (20l capacity) and 5 bars of soaps (each 800mg) and 1 box of female sanitary item.\nConduct comprehensive hygiene promotion activities focusing on behavior change including hand washing with soap practices at critical times through health hygiene education campaigns targeting 18,000 people.\nTrain 10 Community Hygiene Promoters (50% female and 50% male) to conduct hygiene promotion session in project target areas\nTo ensure the sustainability of this action, ARD will collaborate with the affected communities and other humanitarian actors to ensure the affected population are provided with sufficient clean water services through water trucking for a period of 60 days, ARD will ensure to use voucher system through selection of the most vulnerable populations in Merka. Moreover, ARD will construct flood-resistant and gender-sensitive latrines to ensure year-round use as well as the distribution of WASH kits through vouchers, establishment of WASH Management Committees and hygiene sensitization sessions.",

        "description": "With the complex and unpredictable humanitarian situation in Somalia and with the reduced risk of famine in the year 2019, the overall risk still lingers. Two long decades of armed conflicts, clan clashes and drought have resulted in millions of Somalis becoming in dire need of basic life savings assistance. Forced to flee their homes to survive, today there remains a staggering 2.6 million internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Somalia. Based on total numbers, Somalia represents the fourth largest IDP crisis in the world. \n\nCurrently, an estimated 2.6 million people across Somalia remain internally displaced and highly impoverished. Deyr assessment results indicate that the 11 major Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) settlements are in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or Stressed (IPC Phase 2) in the presence of humanitarian assistance. In most urban areas, food security outcomes are Stressed (IPC Phase 2) or Minimal (IPC Phase 1). However, households in urban areas in Burao (Toghdeer) region are facing food consumption gaps and are classified as Crisis (IPC Phase 3), driven by high cost of living and limited income-earning opportunities. This notwithstanding, the sustained and large scale humanitarian coordination is preventing more severe outcomes in many regions across Somalia. \nIn this context ACTED will: Establish, reinforce and strengthen governance, management and coordination mechanisms at appropriate levels Increase site safety through site maintenance and improvement works and Capacity Build Camp Governance, CCCM stakeholders and local authorities working towards self-management. ACTED will implement this intervention in 31 sites across Burao and Buhodle (16 sites in Burao and 15 sites in Buhodle). \n\nFEWS NET Post Deyr technical release projects that in Togdheer region of Somaliland that 181,000 people will be stressed IPC phase 2, 91,000 in crisis IPC phase 3 and 13,000 in emergency IPC phase 4 by June, 2020 if humanitarian assistance is not extended to the region. \n\nCamp coordination and camp management is a relatively new concept within the region and it is of utmost importance that key stakeholders i.e. government officials and humanitarian actors, be sensitized on this concept. It is necessary to increase awareness on this technical concept and equip stakeholders with the relevant capacity to implement such interventions.",

NoFYL will implement a multi-cluster intervention around Protection and CCCM aiming at strengthening coordination structures, improving the coordination, community-led site maintenance activities to ensure the upkeep of sites, support governance structures to ensure community participation and self-management of sites and information management at a site level, sites improvement activities to minimize protection risks and ensure safety in sites. \nOn protection, the intervention is geared toward preventing and responding to eviction, monitoring of threats to evictions by assessing potential eviction sites, monitoring, documentation and reporting to relevant authorities and relevant clusters to mobilize support for advocacy. The advocacy and campaigns will aim to ensure actors facilitate lawful eviction processes. Capacity development targeting settlement managers, local authorities on Housing, Land and proper protection monitoring through ensuring collection of information based on the methodology of the Somalia Protection Monitoring System (SPMS). WASH intervention will be complemented by PAH through the distribution of complete kits of hygiene, capacity building of water committees and community hygiene promotion through community outreach and awareness campaigns, addressing sustainable access to water, hygiene, and capacity building needs. ESNFI intervention will be complemented by HINNA by improving the IDPs living conditions through the distribution of emergency NFI kits and emergency shelter kits.\n\nAt the initial stages of project implementation, the partners will organize an inception meeting with different actors with the support of the relevant cluster Coordinators. Rapid service mapping of actors will also be conducted to understand who is doing what and where to inform intervention areas and avoid duplication. NoFYL field teams shall actively participate in coordination mechanisms in Kaxda and Deynille to ensure other actors are updated on NoFYL plans in targeted districts to avoid overlap. This project will fill existing gaps in ESNFI, CCCM, Protection, and WASH support and complement activities undertaken under other ongoing projects. NoFYL will carry out post-distribution monitoring utilizing a tailored PDM tool in all targeted locations within 1 month of each assistance intervention sampling 20-30% of beneficiaries in each location. \n \nNoFYL, PAH and HINNA will implement these activities in 15 IDP sites in Deynille and Kaxda, targeting the most underserved area home to most newly displaced drought IDPs in the same sites to enhance the delivery of protection services as a complement to the other activities. 4,064 households, approximately 24,384 people (3,283 male, 4,886 female, 6,505 boys and 9,710 girls) will benefit from this intervention, as well as the whole community working in these 41 IDP sites including local authorities, clusters, and other organizations. The multi-sectoral approach will be useful to create synergies enabling the concentration of services and expertise within the same location and the same population leading to achieving a greater impact.\n \nThe three partners (NoFYL, PAH and HINNA) will build on each other strengths and better complement each other to ensure community acceptance and success in implementation.

        "description": "In 2019, COVID-19 emerged, and the WHO has declared its outbreak as a global pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic is a global health crisis that has resulted in a great disruption to education worldwide. Education has been hit particularly hard by the COVID-19 pandemic with 1.53 billion learners out of school and 184 country-wide school closures, impacting 87.6% of the world\u2019s total enrolled learners. Drop-out rates across the globe are likely to rise as a result of this massive disruption to education access. Thus, the Somali Government took precautionary measures as stopping international flights, closing learning institutions, and banning large public gathers. As the Government continues to monitor the situation, CISP plans to mitigate and minimize the impact of school closure and interrupted student learning, particularly for the most vulnerable. As there is a lack of clarity on how the COVID-19 situation will evolve globally and locally in Somalia, CISP will forecast long-term contingency measures ensuring that the impact of COVID-19 on students will be addressed as schools remain closed. In Somalia, it has affected learning and forced the closure of learning institutions including schools and universities since March 18th, 2020. In responding to this outbreak, CISP adapts the Ministry of Education, Culture, and Higher Education (MoECHE) strategy on COVID-19 preparedness and response. \nThe proposed 9-month intervention will target 12 schools with an enrolment of 3462 learners with the provision of food, TLM, and Dignity kit while 19,890 adults and children of school-going age children will be targeted with radio PSA and health messages to provide mitigation measures on the impact of COVID-19 on top of other existing challenges such as conflict, drought and desert locust for learners both school holidays and when schools reopen. The project will improve access to critical WASH inputs, emergency food for students to meet their food and energy needs, payment of emergency teacher incentives to motivate teachers to stay in the schools, provision of teaching and learning materials (TLM). Specific WASH activities will include the distribution of handwashing soaps, liquid detergents, rehabilitation of latrines, provision of storage water tanks, water trucking for schools with no constant water supply, and improving hygiene practices among children through engagement with school hygiene promoters. Following the Federal guideline on social distancing CISP will work with the ministry of health and MoECHE to explore the possibility of having smaller groups of teacher and CEC\u2019s to train so as to maintain 1.5-meter distance in order to implement a lifesaving training of hygiene and Sanitation on preparedness, mitigation and response to COVID-19 pandemic and identification of COVID-19 symptoms to prevent the spread of COVID-19 among the school community. CISP proposes this project to improve access to quality education and making schools child-friendly for COVID-19, drought and conflict-affected communities, and host community children Galgaduud region of Galmudug State of Somalia. The project directly addresses the educational needs of both the displaced and host community children. This project will create a protective environment for children through the improvement of hygiene/sanitation in schools thereby making schools learner-friendly and also the provision of quality education through providing learning resources, general community sensitization through radio PSA will be aired through Galmudug radio station on the COVID-19 pandemic awareness and prevention.",

Currently, 4 million people are experiencing acute food insecurity, out of whom 2.9 million are Stressed (IPC Phase 2) and 1.1 million are facing Crisis or worse. Among the most vulnerable are 2.6 million internally displaced persons (IDPs) who remain highly impoverished. According to IOM, October 2019 report, Baidoa, the capital of Bay region, hosts one of the largest IDP populations in Somalia. According to figures compiled by the international community, as of September 2019, Baidoa had 359,994 internally displaced persons, consisting of 51,322 households on 435 sites.\n\nTherefore, looking into this precarious situation, the proposed project is designed to respond to the immediate lifesaving and life sustaining basic needs of poor and vulnerable displacement affected communities in Bay region. Project proposes three rounds of Multipurpose cash transfers to the most vulnerable displacement affected communities. Moreover, project will also provide cereal crops and vegetable seeds to displacement affected communities living in the off camp area. At the same time this we understand that as a result of locust infestation, beneficiaries pastoral and agro-pastoral communities are forced to migrate to other areas, therefore under this program NRC will be providing Fodder vouchers to the migrating communities. Support in the form of fodder vouchers will help communities to purchase fodder for their livestock during the time of migration. This cash injection will help benefiting households in accessing food and other unmet needs on immediate basis from the accessible markets. The monthly cash transfer amount will be as per the cash and market working group recommended transfer rate which will help beneficiaries to meet 80% of the full minimum expenditure basket. As a result of cash injection, affected households will have improved access to the diversified food and will positively contribute to the nutritional outcomes. \n\nProposed project is in line with the Food Security cluster strategic response objectives SO1: Improve households\u2019 immediate access to food through provision of conditional and unconditional cash assistance depending on the severity of food insecurity phases, vulnerability and seasonality of the livelihoods.\n\nAs soon as beneficiaries identification and  registration will be completed, NRC will be conducting a Baseline survey in order to have baseline values. After baseline, registered beneficiaries will be released monthly multipurpose cash transfer in line to the cash and market recommended transfer rates using electronic services of Harmuud. NRC team will be collecting post distribution monitoring (PDM) data two weeks after release of each round of cash transfer. As a standard practice, PDM captures some of the key information around timeliness of support, progress against critical indicators including \u2018Food consumption score (FCS) and Household dietary diversity score\u2019. PDM also monitors expenditure patterns of the provided support and determines measures for corrective actions if there are deviations from objective.",

The project directly targets an estimated 5160 individuals ( mostly rural communities) particularly women, children and the elderly and other vulnerable persons in Casha Cado, Togoshi, Lawya cado, Sheikh Awaare and Zeyla villages. The project duration is 8 months to allow families to recover from adverse weather conditions and the potential desert locusts\u2019 threat. \n\nSpecifically, 565 households (HH) will receive Unconditional Cash Transfers (UCT) while 300 households will receive Conditional Cash Transfers. The cash transfers empower people with choice to address their essential and individual food needs, while also helping to boost local markets. Another reason for Candlelight to apply cash transfer are the reduced facilitation costs, as mobile transfers do require less administrative costs. The cash values to be transferred on a monthly basis are provided by the Cash Working Group (CWG) Somalia based on minimum expenditure basket (MEB) as per region across Somalia. The latest food cash transfer values for families in Awdal are USD 90 (October - December 2019)\n\nThe target group for the UCT will mainly be the rural and most vulnerable families facing high levels of food insecurity among other vulnerabilities. The timeframe for UCT to be disbursed will be 4 months to stabilize food security levels in the lean and Ramadhan seasons. The major activities for UCT will start with sharing selection criteria in a transparent manner with village leaders and communities. \n\nA local telephone company (Telesom) with extensive experience of conducting cash transfer to beneficiaries in remote areas will be commissioned to conduct monthly cash transfers to beneficiaries mobile phones. The beneficiaries who may not know how to use the services will be trained on how to use it. \n\nFor conditional cash transfers relating to Cash for Work (CfW) activities, the project will follow a similar selection and disbursement cycle. As part of CfW, the project will, village cleaning campaigns and rehabilitation/ replanting of mangrove forests especially in Toqoshi and Zeyla villages to provide for sustainable communal livelihood assets that enhance collective resilience. The individual sites for CfW activities will be identified together with the communities. The CfW beneficiary selection criterion will be their physical capacity in conjunction with the vulnerability of their families, such as families with more than three children, or families who lost major parts of their livestock and livelihoods. The families with men eligible for CfW might not be as vulnerable as the families receiving the UCT, however they have a risk of sliding into crisis mode. Beneficiaries shall be paid at a rate of approximately 7 USD each based on a standard piece of work but each beneficiary working for atleast 13 days in a month. Each 50 Cash for Work beneficiaries will be supervised by 1 foreman who will be paid a slightly high rate of approximately 10 USD each working day.",

The 7-month project will be implemented in 10 villages in Abudwak. The project has two outputs. Output one will contribute to 400 food-insecure households (2400 people \u2013 1224 Male and 1176 Female) having immediate access to food through unconditional Cash transfer. Of these,  200 HH are IDPs located in Abudwaq town. \nOutput 2 targets 1,632 HH (9794 people) in the protection and restoration of their livelihoods for increased food and income sources. Of these, 900 HH will benefit from animal treatment meant to restore approximately 27,000 livestock to better health. This intervention will improve the livestock economic value as well as the value of meat and milk for household consumption. 6,000 additional and emaciated livestock will receive animal feed concentrate for a month to help them recover their health and increase production. The project will install a solar-powered pumping system to pump water from the Dalsan village borehole to the elevated village water tank which will then use gravity to distribute to the village water kiosk and livestock watering troughs that were constructed by NAPAD with funding from German-FFO. Over 430 HH in Dalsan will benefit from climate and economic friendly source of water for their livestock estimated to be 12,960. To increase household access to nutritious food 100 women will be supported to diversify into small scale kitchen gardening of vegetables and fruits. These women will be capacity built on kitchen gardening, supported with seeds and farming tools and mentored by NAPAD agronomist in establishing the kitchen gardens in their homesteads. The farms will be designed to ensure that the least amount of water is utilized in agricultural production. Women from the Dalsan village will especially benefit from the proposed solar water pumping system that will provide water to irrigate the kitchen gardens. Inagabille households and livestock will get their water from NAPAD constructed, G-FFO funded elevated 60,000 litres tank and animal troughs.

Each proposed health facility serves as an entry point to the connected women\u2019s and girls\u2019 safe space where vulnerable women and girls may, upon request, access PSS and referrals to specialized GBV services including CMR \n\nMultiple feedback channels will be established to ensure accountability and responsive programming. RI will communicate the availability of all feedback mechanisms and beneficiary right to share. RI adheres to the Somali Treatment Guidelines, actively participates in cluster and coordination meetings, submits data on a monthly basis, and relies on national and MoH staff expertise to implement program activities. Through close collaboration with other partners in Beletweyne, RI will work to minimize redundancy and maximize impact.",

        "description": "Communicable diseases specifically for children under five and women is a major contributor to maternal and child mortality and morbidity among the populations in humanitarian crisis in Jalalaqsi. Access to basic primary healthcare  services is severely constrained due  to funding gaps that has resulted in in very few health facilities functioning.The proposed project aims at scaling up primary health services in two health centers managed by ZamZam. Services provided at the health centers will be based on the EPHS standards for Somalia.The health facilities will be strengthened to provide  MPHSS services and CMR for GBV survivors. Existing staff will be trained and re-deployed. Essential health supplies will be procured  and made available in the supported sites.To take services closer to the rural villages and undeserved populations,the project will also operationalize one well equipped mobile health unit that will visit 11 villages.The unit will be attached to one of the health centers and will provide  emergency health services five days a week.The mobile health unit will provide immunization for children under one,treat common illnesses using IMNCI strategy,focused antenatal care,postnatal care,education and awareness on common illnesses and malnutrition among other important actions. One  ambulance will be hired to support referral of children with danger signs and obstetric emergencies.In total ,40600 persons among them 1624 children under one,8120 children under five and 3654 pregnant and lactating women are expected to directly access health services through the planned intervention.The project will be integrated with other complementary interventions implemented by ZamZam as well as other organizations working in the region. ZamZam is already running CMAM program which will easily integrate with the planned project.Quality assurance measures including quarterly joint support supervisions,data quality checks and continuous monitoring visits will be prioritized.In addition, community health promotion activities will also included public health messages on COVID-19 risks of outbreak in Somalia. In addition, ZAMZAM will scale up COVID-19 Risk communication and Community engagement:\n1. Training of Health workers on implementation of standard Infection prevention and control guidelines of COVID 19\n2.

        "description": "According to FSNAU Post Deyr 2019/2020 technical assessment, the overall health, food security and nutrition needs remain significant within most parts of Somalia with an estimated 43% of rural Nugal and Burtinle population in urgent need of humanitarian assistance (73,433 people, among them 2,073 in emergency, 21,350 in crisis and 50,010  being stressed. Nugaal region has consistently reported poor maternal amp child health and nutrition indicators ridden by high child and maternal morbidity rates, crude mortality rates and under 5 mortality rates. In December 2019, EPHS project that supported health and nutrition intervention in Nugaal came to a close. This left ta gap in health and nutrition in Nugaal. The Proposed project  will therefore bridge the major essential health care service gap that currently exists in Burtinle following the close out of the EPHS Project. The  project will  address the identified gaps in nutrition and health, enhancing access to integrated basic health and nutrition care services within their localities aimed at improving the physical and mental well-being of boys, girls, men and women in the targeted locations.  These specific needs have been outlined in the HNO, HRP and FSNAU and MOH gaps identified in the targeted locations. The proposed project is geared towards reducing the vulnerability of the beneficiaries and communities. World Vision Somalia (WV Som)  will work  with MOH to address the health and nutrition gaps identified. The services will be both preventive and curative targeting vulnerable men, women, boys, girls and persons living with physical disabilities in the 2 targeted districts. 1 Mobile and outreach implementation models will be adopted to address the unique needs of vulnerable beneficiaries in remote and geographically isolated populations in  Burtinle district.  Screening for malnutrition will be carried out and children with SAM will be treated in OTP sites. Children with MAM will be  registered through SCOPE to access  TSFP that is supported by WFP. Children diagnosed with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) with medical complication will be referred to the  SCs that World Vision propose to support in Burtinle  district.  At each of the 4  MCHs, WVI shall establish basic reproductive health care services aligned within the MISP framework, utilizing the ambulances to refer mothers with complications from the MCHs and PHUs to the hospitals. At each PHU WV shall build the capacity of the community midwives to provide basic reproductive health care services in remote hard to reach areas as a mitigation measure against preventable maternal morbidity and mortality. While engaging community volunteers, WV shall adopt Timed and targeted counselling (TTC) approach focusing on pre conception to the first 1000 days of a child\u2019s life also incorporating the Finish baby kit and Fortified rice and lentils (Vitameal) as a motivator for adoption of promoted health seeking practices among WCBA through enhancing access to Reproductive health care services, child health including Immunization ,IYCF and hygiene promotion care and care-giver led MUAC screening and referral . At 4 targeted MCHs and PHUs WV has an already established GBV care system with personnel already trained and necessary CMR supplies in place to respond to GBV cases.  World Vision will ensure that beneficiaries visiting the targeted facilities including beneficiaries served at the mobile sites access a comprehensive basic package of services .Towards health and nutrition promotion, World Vision will focus on NHHP, care-giver led MUAC screening that will be done at the project sites with the nutrition beneficiaries is linked with the food security and safety net interventions to enhance household food basket.",

It is also contributing to the cluster priority of filling critical gaps in health care services for populations facing high incidence of malnutrition and service gaps.\nThe project has also been designed with full awareness of the prevailing gender norms and deeply rooted gender inequalities in Somalia that limit women and girls from accessing basic services such as health and nutrition, and expose them to a higher risk of GBV. In order to address these challenges, Save the Children will identify and work to remove the physical, cognitive and social barriers by collaborating closely with the communities and particularly the influencers and gatekeepers. We will also address the intersectionality of vulnerability factors, for example women with disabilities or from minor clans who are likely to face multiple levels of discrimination.\nThe project will contribute to improving equitable access to quality life-saving curative and preventative health and nutrition services through the support of static health facilities complemented by mobile outreach services. There will be one integrated health and nutrition mobile team in Garowe district. The integrated health and nutrition mobile team will provide outpatient consultations, routine immunizations, maternal healthcare, disease surveillance and health promotion as well as systematic identi\ufb01cation, referral and treatment of acutely malnourished cases by providing integrated nutrition services to out-patient therapeutic programme (OTP), Targeted Supplementary Feeding Program (TSFP) and stabilization centers. The provision of OTP services for those with Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) and the referral and treatment of SAM cases with medical complications to the nearest stabilization centre. Micronutrient supplementation, promotion of Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF) practices, promotion of adoption of good hygiene and sanitation practices will be done, providing treatment for all age groups, both male and female. The health and nutrition interventions will improve early identification and prevention of malnutrition, and access to primary health care, and therefore reduce excess morbidity and mortality. As part of gender and social norms transformation we will ensure that the activities include positive messaging for men in their roles as fathers. Women and girls will be seen by health practitioners of the same sex and consultations and documentation will be kept confidential.\nSave the Children (SC) will support nine fixed facilities in the following locations Waabari MCH, Gabmbool MCH, Gargar MCH, Jilab MCH, Barwaaqo MCH,Bahnano 1 MCH, Bahnano 2 MCH, Hanano MCH and Awrculus MCH    with integrated health and nutrition services in addition to the mobile and iCCM services. SC will carry out regular safety audits of the facilities to identify and mitigate the risks faced by women and girls in accessing services and resources.\nWe would like to note that Save the Children is working closely with partners to monitor and respond to the ongoing COVID 19 pandemic and will plan to modify and adapt programme activities according to the emerging situation if necessary. Save the Children will be considering the four following dimensions and is currently developing plans for staff health, business continuity, programme preparedness and programme response.",

        "description": "Trocaire has been the main provider of Health services in Gedo since 1992, operating all main hospitals in northern Gedo in partnership with District Health Boards and, more recently, the Ministry of Health. This proposed intervention will provide integrated lifesaving Health and WASH services to 3,987 men, 3,767 women, 3,588 boys, and 3,404 girls from Burdhubo location in Garbaharey district. These will include approximately 7,373 IDPs, 7,373 host community members, and 730 individuals with different forms of disability. Trocaire will work closely with the government District Medical Officers, the Burdhubo District Health Board, the District Commissioner's office, other implementing partners and with coordination through the Health and WASH clusters. Coordination will be prioritized as it remains a key assumption of the project for effective and efficient delivery of integrated lifesaving assistance to vulnerable and marginalized populations in Burdhubo. Health interventions aim to provide primary and essential lifesaving services in an inclusive manner. With a few private health facilities in Burdhubo, the population remains under-served, with children, pregnant and lactating mothers facing unimaginable challenges as they walk long distances of up to 40 kilometres to access health services. Trocaire will therefore work with the above stakeholders to re-establish affordable, accessible, and inclusive health services to both vulnerable IDP and host communities. This will require minor rehabilitation of 1 static health facility- Burdhubo Health Centre, and equipment and management of 1 mobile outreach team that will access beneficiaries in 5 outreach sites. Waiting shades will be constructed in these five sites to ensure dignified assistance is provided in a safe, accessible environment. Health workers will be trained to handle different components of health activities including Clinical Management of Rape, immunizations, emergency trauma care, communicable disease treatment, TB screening and treatment etc. Specialized services, which require referral to nearby hospitals, will be facilitated. The Trocaire-managed health facility in Garbaharey town will be the main referral point, as it is equipped as a referral hospital.\nWASH services will complement health services through relations with the health outreach teams, working closely to reduce morbidity and mortality rates, as well as reducing cases of malnutrition. Preventive approaches will be utilized through 11 hygiene promotion sessions with community-based staff/ volunteers. Hand-washing practices will be promoted through distribution of 1,000 hygiene kits through restricted cash vouchers in collaboration with the WASH cluster hub, as well as other partners on the ground, if any. According to assessment data collected in early March 2020, about 90 percent of the population in Burdhubo use untreated and unsafe water from the river, which is also too far a distance for most of the HHs. Within this project, Trocaire will seek to construct one hybrid shallow well with water treatment encouraged at the household level to encourage uptake of safe and clean water. One representative Water-User Management Committees (WMCs) will be set up to manage the shallow wells created. 70 emergency latrines will be constructed and hand-washing facilities with soap installed. Hygiene promotion sessions will be held. Trocaire is discussing with other partners to ensure that once this project is operational there will be opportunities to continue implementing necessary services, and working closely with the local, regional and national stakeholders to ensure that they are well equipped to continue provision of these services, when time is right for Trocaire to exit.",

The former includes the ability of Public Works Authorities to work with all relevant stakeholders and ensure the involvement of local communities and other marginalized groups (e.g. women and the youth). The enhanced and certified expertise of youth achieved through the project\u2019s activities will lead to an increase of employment in the sector, result in higher household incomes and help rebuilt the country.

It consists of two broad components namely: (i) strengthening domestic revenue mobilization and public financial management; and (ii) advancing financial sector development. The operation has been designed in anticipation of Somalia\u2019s arrears clearance, a process being undertaken by the United Kingdom (UK). It takes into account the need for the Bank to step up its re-engagement with Somalia, post-arrears clearance, and to support the country\u2019s on-going economic and financial reforms. The implementation of the reforms being supported by the program is expected to lead to high, sustainable and inclusive growth for Somalia.

The project will contribute to capacity enhancement in macroeconomic management through strengthened revenue and PFM institutions, as well as improving transparency and accountability for better public service delivery. It builds on the work of the previous financial governance projects, and aims to consolidate their achievements. Specific areas that will be maintained include support to debt management and budget preparation. The project has three mutually reinforcing components: (i) Strengthening macro-economic planning and management (ii) Enhancing control, transparency and accountability in the use of public resources, and (iii) strengthening capacity for project management. The expected outcomes are: (i) Enhanced domestic revenue mobilization which will be measured through increased revenue to GDP ratio, and; (ii) Improved fiscal space to increase share of budget allocated to social sectors.

Indeed, the state of disrepair of water and sanitation infrastructure is a major factor contributing to significant outbreaks of water-borne diseases, particularly diarrhea whose incidence rate in Somalia is 21%. The interventions proposed under this project will therefore improve the quality of life of about 175,000 people and their livestock in rural Somalia. They are articulated around the following two operational components: 1) capacity building and 2) construction / rehabilitation of water supply and sanitation infrastructure for stability and resilience that will create about 1,300 jobs. In addition, the project will promote the use of water for multiple purposes, community mobilization campaigns and awareness of health and hygiene issues will be conducted, practices of nond\u00e9f\u00e9cation in the open, through the community-led total sanitation approach will also be promoted.
