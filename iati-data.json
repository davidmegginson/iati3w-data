Greater attention will be given to the inclusion of the marginalized and women. The programme aims to achieve three outcomes: i) Outcome 1: Policy, legal and regulatory frameworks on local governance finalized: - Policy and legislative frameworks for functional, fiscal and administrative decentralization clarify the role of local governments and their relationship to federal/central and state governments, with a view to attaining improved service delivery and stability. ii) Outcome 2: Local governments\u2019 have the capacity to deliver equitable and sustainable services, promote economic development and peace:- Building on the successes and lessons from previous phases, JPLG will consolidate, harmonize and systematize, its capacity enhancement approaches \u2013 bearing in mind the different contexts under which it operates. In Somaliland, the focus will be to empower Local Government Institute (LGIs) as drivers of capacity building initiatives. In Puntland, and the new states the programme will work with the Ministries of Interior and other partner ministries to streamline capacity development initiatives while, putting in place mechanisms to operationalise the recently approved National Local Government Capacity Development Policy (see Annex 3). It will focus on supporting capacity development beyond JPLG districts and apply capacity development lessons from Puntland to boost the new FMSs and BRA. In the new federal member states, the program will build local governments\u2019 capacity to deliver equitable services, deepen stabilization and contribute to economic recovery. iii) Outcome 3: Local governments demonstrate improved engagement of citizens, with an emphasis on women and marginalized groups:-The aim of JPLG III is to promote citizen engagement, gender equity and social inclusion, through efforts to strengthen key local governance policies, structures and processes. Barriers to women\u2019s advancement in public administration, denial of opportunities for citizens, particularly traditionally marginalized individuals and groups, to take part in, and benefit from, local decision-making, all serve to undermine the principles of equal opportunity and social justice that are the bedrock of inclusive development and democratic governance \u2013 while retaining a driver of conflict.",

        "description": "Somalia\u2019s population is currently experiencing multiple shocks (\u2018triple threat\u2019 \u2013 locust, drought, COVID-19): the Desert Locust upsurge that started in late 2019  and continues to threaten the food security and livelihoods of pastoralists and farmers in many parts of the country; riverine and flash floods that affect the food security, livelihoods and safety of farmers and people living in flood-prone, populated areas; the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic that is having severe health and socio-economic impacts both in Somalia and globally; and the extended impact of previous shocks (flooding, drought, displacement, etc.) on livelihoods.\nAssessments by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), Food Security and Nutrition Analysis Unit (FSNAU) andFamine Early Warning SystemsNetwork (FEWSNET) also indicate that, in the absence of humanitarian assistance, up to 2.1 million people across Somalia are expected to face food consumption gaps or depletion of assets indicative of Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or worse outcomes through December 2020. In addition, 849 900 children under the age of five are likely to be acutely malnourished through August 2021 . Crisis (IPC Phase 3)outcomes are expected from June to September in parts of central Somalia, where livestock holdings are lowest, and in northeastern Somalia, where the economy is more dependent on livestock, seafood, and frankincense exports. The socioeconomic impacts of COVID-19 have led to a 30-50 % decline in annual external remittances, an anticipated25-35 % decline in annual livestock exports, lower labour demand, and above average imported staple food prices.\nBesides adverse weather conditions and conflict resulting in food insecurity and hunger, other prevailing challenges in the project areas Oxfam and partners Candlelight, Havoyoco and KAALO work are poor access to water and inadequate hygiene and sanitation conditions, as well as displacement. Against this backdrop,  the proposed activities aim at assisting both IDPs and host communities. Access to clean and safe water is a major area of concern in our intervention areas in Somaliland and Puntland.\nOur proposed activities focus on relieving the distress suffered by affected families, preventing their situation from getting worse and strengthening collective resilience mechanisms. In terms of sectors we will focus on Food Security <(>&<)> Livelihoods (FSL), Water, Sanitation <(>&<)> Hygiene (WASH), Protection (PRO), Multi-Purpose Cash (MPCT) and Accountability (ACC).\nOxfam and partners Candlelight, Havoyoco and KAALO will work in the following regions and districts/locations: Awdal (Baki), Sool (Las Anod, Xudun, Bocaame), Sanaag (Eerigavo), Bari (Bossaso), Mudug (Jariiban). Partners have been implementing SOMJR activities in these regions and locations since 2019 (Awdal, Sool, Sanaag) and 2020 (Bari, Mudug), and were able to invest in the resilience building of target communities. Bocaame in Sool has been added as a new location to the SOMJR: it has already been targeted by partner KAALO during the DRA-funded Desert Locust Joint Response (May to October 2020), however, needs remain high as Bocaame is highly affected by insecurity and recurring waves of desert locust invasions.",

        "description": "Somalia has experienced recurrent droughts since 2011 which have been increasingly exacerbated by climate change. Agro-pastoralistsand pastoralists have been badly affected by the 2019 drought which has caused widespread crop failure, water shortages, and depleted livestock levels.\nMore than 4.2 million people were estimated to be in need of humanitarian assistance in 2019, and the number ofpeople who are food insecure is expected to increase in the coming months.  This year#s severe drought has been caused by abnormally hot, dry conditions during January-March and the failure of the rains in April-June. Most households are already adopting negativecoping strategies to mitigate food insecurity, including reducing food intake. Poor transportation and market infrastructure make it difficult for pastoralists to access markets, and there are few fed markets to provide animals with nutrition when natural pastures are inadequate. Over 80% of livestock was lost as a result of the 2017 drought, and the population of livestock herds, essential for pastoralists# food and income, have not yet recovered.\nThe impact of the 2019 drought on the water and sanitation sector has beensignificant. Water supply (boreholes, shallow wells) is severely limited and the cost of accessing water has increased sharply, representing a severe burden on insufficient household income. Existing groundwater sources contain a highly mineralized content, rendering it unsuitable for drinking, but a prior Oxfam needs assessment showed that the vast majority of households in the project area do not treat their water. Open defecation remains common, increasing protection risks for women and girls who venture outside alone or during the night or move far from dwellings to known open defecation areas.\nOxfam aims to assist at least 500,000 affected peoplewith immediate food security and WASH programming along with resilience and recovery interventions to diminish the impact of recurring droughts on vulnerable populations. Oxfam will embed activities to strengthen the protection of women, men, boys, and girls within the EFSVL and WASH workstreams.",

Thus far, MoPCA has implemented an awareness programs, which arenow broadcast on Radio and TV. The radio program has a wide coverage of people as it reaches almost all over the country. Furthermore, MoPCA has signed agreement with the Ministry of Education and Science as regards incorporating civic educationcourses into the curriculum of high primary schools, secondary schools and universities. The curriculum for the three preceding streams has been finalized recently and the teaching of the civic education is expected to begin soon.\nIn addition, MoPCA intends to train all government institutions to ensure that such institutions respect the constitutional rights of the citizens. The essence of the training of the government institutions on the constitutional rights is to enhance the protection of basic human rights and to strengthen the rule of law. So far, MoPCA has trained the Good Governance and Anti Corruption Commission as well as 1000 young men who were undertaking their National Service training at Dararweyne training school. The ministry also visited regional universities to train National Service girls who were attached to different universities to complete their national service requirements. MoPCA will continue training other government institutions on constitutional rights of the citizens.\nSimilarly, the Ministry has also distributed large quantities of the copies of the constitution as well as brochures and pamphlets aimed at raising citizens# awareness vis-\u00e0-vis their constitutional rights and their obligations as well. The ministry is also planning to visit regions and hold town-hall meetings with different citizens residing in regions. The aim of these town-hall meetings is to disseminate the constitution and to gather data as regards the views and opinions of society with respect to theirknowledge about their constitutional rights.

Humanitarian response focuses on WaSH, EVFSL and Protection.\nOxfam has made a lot of gains through humanitarian resilience programmes which are likely to be eroded if the desert locust menace is uncontrolled. Oxfam will therefore capitalise and work with the existing community structures such as Early Warning Committees, Government line ministries, FAO and other stakeholders on the preventive and control measures.\nOxfam will prioritize safeguarding livelihoods focusing on cash intervention and locust control measures.\n\nA total of 1,056 people in coastal areas of Sool region will be reachedby the project and supported toprotect and recover their livelihoods.\n\nOxfam has vast experience in implementing conditional and unconditional cash transfer approaches in WASH, EVFSL programmes. The project will specifically focus on the Cash for Work(CfW) approach as it not only empowers individuals to spend based on their priority needs but also focuses on revamping community assets. CfW will therefore stimulate the recovery of the local economy by creating short-term work, reintroduce income flow,supporting local businesses through the purchase worktools while also encouraging households to purchase food and non-food items locally. The trench digging will involve large numbers of the population and will be designed to encourage the integration and participation of women and other marginalized groups in an area thus benefitting the entire community and not just a few individuals.\n\nThe project will support communities to address locust spread by burying them in trenches excavated through cash for work. A total of 1,056 people will dig 26 km of trenches and drive hopper bands through cash for work, this task will continue for 30 days, 15 days per month starting in mid-March 2020. This task is expected to minimize hopper bands probability to turn to dangerous swarm level while at the same time communities will be able to access cash to help them address food insecurity situation at household level.\n\nOxfam will closely cooperate with the Somaliland Ministry of agriculture",

Two pathways are geared towards service delivery through competence development, while the third is about influencing.\nPathway 1:\nWe build young people\u2019s skillsfor today and the future to find paid jobs or set up their own enterprises.\nWiP! will continue to provide new cohorts of young people with 21st century and technical skills. In a rapidly changing labour market, this will better prepare them to find a job and givethem the confidence to plan their future. Collaboration with educational institutions will be strengthened to ensure scale-up and\nsustainability by integrating 21st century skills, Futures Literacy1 and other training modules developed during WiP! into their curricula, and by promoting internships. Additionally, youth will be trained in the skills, tools and mindset of design thinking to solve complex social issues.\nAfter training, job fairs will be organized to link the students with employers. Providing service deliverythrough skills building goes\nhand in hand with influencing government and employers to promote and provide decent jobs for young people.\nWe assume that 21st century skills such as Futures Literacy and design thinking will prepare young women and men for the future job market. We also assume that teachers and trainers are convinced these skills are needed to\nprepare for the future job market, and that there are enough employers to absorb trained young people.\nPathway 2:\nNot all young people are looking for a job \u2013 many want to be entrepreneurs. We accelerate startups and offer business development services (BDS) to impact-driven small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) so they can employ more young people \u2013 improving the demand side of the market \u2013 and deepen their social and environmental impact. We aim to improve networks, knowledge, skills and access to finance and investors for new entrepreneurs and established SMEs while further activating and training private sector professionals as\ncoaches and mentors. To contribute to a greener economy, we started focusing even more on sustainable entrepreneurship and integrating the training on circular business models which we started in 2019.\nWe assume in this pathway that young people (men and women) are recruited once SMEs and startups grow. We assume investors are interested to invest in early startups and in the trained SMEs. And we assume that SMEs are open to adapting their business models with elements of the circular economy to contribute to a greener future.\nPathway 3\nWiP! aims to improve the enabling environment for youthand enterprises. Building on the relationships established in the first three and a half years, we will\nengage with different actors (governments, private sector and young citizens) to improve the implementation of policies on decent jobs and supportingstartups and SMEs.\nWorking with role models, we will have youth- led public campaigning to raise awareness about obstacles they face. We will especially emphasize issues women entrepreneurs\nface because of their gender. We will aim in particular to improvethe internship policy in Somalia to bridge the gap between study and work, and policies of banks and workplaces in Nigeria to improve SMEs\u2019 access to loans and create more decent jobs for young people.\nFor pathway 3 we assume that we can change attitudes and beliefs in a short period of four years. We assume that educational institutes will be able to adapt their curricula to include the 21stcentury skills trainings. We assume government officials are willing to implement the policies we advise andwork with them\nto develop. And we assume that cultural and social norms and practices on gender roles can evolve to encourage more women to become entrepreneurs.",

Collaboration with educational institutions will be strengthened to ensure scale-up and\nsustainability by integrating 21st century skills, Futures Literacy1 and other training modules developed during WiP! into their curricula, and by promoting internships. Additionally, youth will be trained in the skills, tools and mindset of design thinking to solve complex social issues.\nAfter training, job fairs will be organized to link the students with employers. Providing service deliverythrough skills building goes\nhand in hand with influencing government and employers to promote and provide decent jobs for young people.\nWe assume that 21st century skills such as Futures Literacy and design thinking will prepare young women and men for the future job market. We also assume that teachers and trainers are convinced these skills are needed to\nprepare for the future job market, and that there are enough employers to absorb trained young people.\nPathway 2:\nNot all young people are looking for a job \u2013 many want to be entrepreneurs. We accelerate startups and offer business development services (BDS) to impact-driven small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) so they can employ more young people \u2013 improving the demand side of the market \u2013 and deepen their social and environmental impact. We aim to improve networks, knowledge, skills and access to finance and investors for new entrepreneurs and established SMEs while further activating and training private sector professionals as\ncoaches and mentors. To contribute to a greener economy, we started focusing even more on sustainable entrepreneurship and integrating the training on circular business models which we started in 2019.\nWe assume in this pathway that young people (men and women) are recruited once SMEs and startups grow. We assume investors are interested to invest in early startups and in the trained SMEs. And we assume that SMEs are open to adapting their business models with elements of the circular economy to contribute to a greener future.\nPathway 3\nWiP! aims to improve the enabling environment for youthand enterprises. Building on the relationships established in the first three and a half years, we will\nengage with different actors (governments, private sector and young citizens) to improve the implementation of policies on decent jobs and supportingstartups and SMEs.\nWorking with role models, we will have youth- led public campaigning to raise awareness about obstacles they face. We will especially emphasize issues women entrepreneurs\nface because of their gender. We will aim in particular to improvethe internship policy in Somalia to bridge the gap between study and work, and policies of banks and workplaces in Nigeria to improve SMEs\u2019 access to loans and create more decent jobs for young people.\nFor pathway 3 we assume that we can change attitudes and beliefs in a short period of four years. We assume that educational institutes will be able to adapt their curricula to include the 21stcentury skills trainings. We assume government officials are willing to implement the policies we advise andwork with them\nto develop. And we assume that cultural and social norms and practices on gender roles can evolve to encourage more women to become entrepreneurs.",

        "description": "# Solarization of two existing water sources   in Baki and Saylac districts of Awdal benefiting more than 10,000 people and their livestock. Awdal is one of the regions affected by COVID19 as it connects Somaliland to Djibouti. The majority of people are dependent pity trades, small scale irrigation, and livestock, most of these activities have been affected, and communities reported a reduction of income. Existing water supply sources are mainly powered by a diesel generator that are purchased from the tariffs collected from the users. Associated water tariffs are sky rocking as access to diesel has reduced as restrictions are imposed on public transport. Out of the many strategic water sources, two sources are selected, supplying water for villages affected by COVID19 in Somaliland. Oxfam will install a solar system for these wells, and the action will reduce the cost of water tariff and increase community use of water for different purposes include handwashing.\n# Build the capacity of the WASH committees managing the solarizedse water sources by providing necessary tools and training them on both technical skill and financial management. This action will be led by the ministry of water department of scheme management. As we mobilize for the two sources an additional two boreholes within the sameareas will also be invited for the training. These will help to maximize use of expert time, cover nearby villages with capacity building plan and increase value for money by targeting more with same budget.\n# Support Somaliland Ministry of Water Development to ministry of water to finalize   the design and construction for WASH facilities to be shared with all WASH Cluster members in Somaliland. The national WASH cluster has prioritized this action as per the request from ministry and Oxfam will contribute for this action. The budget will be used to cover some of the consultancy fees or provide expertise to help them finalize the work.\n# Provide safeprogramming training for WaSH committees, district administrations, women groups other key stakeholders including traditional leaders    .\n# Protection awareness raising including community discussions on protection impact to address stigma and promotion of the call centre hotline   (already operational) to increase access to covid19 services for affected communities    .\n# Government capacity building/strengthen social safety net system in Somaliland : we will build the capacity of the government to be able to lead and coordinate Somaliland safety net program. Somalia launched safety net project called bahnano at Mogadishu but this has not been cascaded to Somaliland and Puntland. The government staff responsible for this are unable to run safety net due to their limited capacity. The project will target technical staff from the government and create enabling environment in the form of institutional capacity building including training of key staff, support implementation of beneficiaries selection and running coordination mechanisms smoothly.  Oxfam Somalia is implementing social safety net activity under GFFO top up. Under this activity the project aims improving supports to HHs in urban areas particularly COVID19 affected poorest or most vulnerable to prevent them to fall to poverty and destitution trap, manage COVID19 economic and social shocks and advance their lives <(>&<)> livelihoods. The government capacity in Somaliland on social safety net is to grow and as part of appeal fund, Oxfam will contribute to strengthening/establishing social protection system that leads COVID19 response project. Oxfam will partner with Somaliland Ministry of Employment, Social and Family as socialprotection responsible government body. Somaliland government capacity is yet to grow and this project will address this gap while also coordinating with other implementing agencies to strengthen their capacity to be able to lead social assistance and provide at scale in the future to its society as a right. The project creates an opportunity for governments to become the standard responders to large scale crises.",

        "description": "Harhub in partnership with Oxfam is launching a social innovation challenge to tackle most pressing social issues. The partners areaiming to harness the innovations of young people in Somaliland and beyond particularly social entrepreneurs, developers, changemakers, and health practitioners keen on bringing game-changing solutions to most vital social challenges focusing on in the areas of agriculture, technology, SDGs, health, food, education, and energy. The partners believe that tackling these complex issues will require diverse skill sets, backgrounds, effort and innovation. Harhub will be prioritizing innovations which may already be proven but will reach new heights of interest within the industry given the right support from Harhub, or innovations which are new ideas and concepts, but might need some tuning to fit the requirements of potential customers.\nThrough a competitive process, Harhub will reachout to 10k youth through social media promotions to apply the program for three weeks. Harhub is expected to receive quite big and competitive projects. Whilst applicants are ongoing, Harhub will create mentors\u2019 criteria and hire 3 mentors to lead selection and the Bootcamp. All the submitted projects will be evaluated by the mentors based on the solutions\u2019 unique value proposition, social impact, visibility, technical viability, and the individuals\u2019/teams\u2019 ability and capability to scale the solution.\n\nIn total, the mentors will then select twenty most advanced and innovative projects to attendthe two full days Bootcamp to be held at Harhub. The Bootcamp will be a high-energy workshop focused on rapid ideation, refinement, and prototyping of solutions. It is a space to generate, iterate on, and test ideas for social impact, foster a culture ofinnovation through experimentation, collaboration, and expand a community of social impact innovators. In the final event, twenty finalists will pitch their solutions for a chance to win grant funding, incubation, and mentorship scheme. The top three projects will be awarded a grant fund to their projects at Harhub with all support of providing free incubation and mentorship to develop, validate, execute and scale their solutions",

According to Somaliland\u2019s Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, UNDP and the World Bank reports, over 70% of Somaliland\u2019s population is under the age of 30. The unemployment rate for youth aged 15 to 30 is 67% - one of the highest rates in the world. Among young women, it is even estimated at 74%. Youth in Somaliland are not just the future ofthe country, they are also the majority.\nWith 67% of the youth being out of work, the high unemployment rate forthe youth remains abig challenge in Somaliland, and this rate is even higher for young women. The unemployment rate for young women in the country is estimated to be 74%. Due to the insecurity over the last two decade and stagnant economic growth, jobs have not been created at a rate that is able to match the growth of the youth population.\nWomen often face stiff competition during business pitching/competitions and often shy away to compete with their fellow men or observe stigmatization. This conceptwill bridge this gap by specifically earmarking this Women in Tech competition for young women tech savvies to compete among each other.\nTo achieve a long lasting and sustainable economic and social transformation in the country, we must empower young women, create opportunities for prosperity and provide them with the necessary tools and resources.\nHence Innovate Ventures (IV) in partnership and collaboration with Oxfam aim to support, accelerate and grow the Somali women startup scene and accelerate the growth of women startups in technology to help them create employment opportunities, and improve the investment climate in the country",

This intervention forms approximately 70% of the total cash transfer programming under Oxfam\u2019s overall response and will be implemented directly by Oxfam by engaging electronic financial service provider in Puntland via mobile phones. Beneficiarieswho don\u2019t possess Sim-cards will receive them as part of this response and be trained on its usage. The overall Oxfam food securityintervention which this contributes towards will include additional emergency livelihoods and recovery elements including cash for work interventions to rebuild destroyed feeder roads.Oxfam targets households that meet the critical food insecurity criteria takingintoconsideration gender-differentiated needs. The selection criteria will be discussed with thetarget women, men, boys and girls toensure fairness of the selection process. Usually, women are registered as beneficiaries and the head of the household for cash transfers. At times we find that some polygamous households are includedduring registration stage and this is addressed during verification, ensuring that the most vulnerable HH are Commented [AC12]: In addition to these activities DEC funds can also be used to coverany hygiene promotion activities/hygiene kits, COVID messaging, PPE for staffif needed?Commented [MH13R12]: We Have some PPE in thefield, Moses to add purchase of some PPE in the budget\ntargeted, in collaboration with community leaders. Female-headed households are the most affected as they do not have access to meaningful household assets such as livestock, or other sources of income. In Bari region, priorities for livelihood regeneration activities are different for women and men. Oxfam will deliver emergency food security interventions through cash grants for the most vulnerable people, while supporting household income by strengtheningand diversifying livelihoods through other projects. Oxfam's programming since March 2017 has successfully diversified the source of livelihoods in traditional pastoralist communities in Somaliland with plansto replicate this expereicnce in Puntland. This intervention will help vulnerable households to have some disposable income which they can use to purchase or meet their household food needs.Most vulnerable community members that will be most in need of the emergency assistance through this action will be identified through participatory mapping exercises conducted at village level through specific exercises including well-being rankings, vulnerability mapping, food consumption score, household purchasing power, among others. Gender will be consideredwhen selecting households to help reduce the additional burden on women headedhouseholds.

While  situation  was  dire  alreadydueto protracted  conflicts and drought, COVID 19 pandemic emergence detoriorated both health and livelihood sources of Somali community. In DEC phase 2, Oxfam plans to provide an integrated WASH and food security project to support emergency food  crises and  support  recovery  of livelihoods lost  due  to  drought  or  COVID  19  pandemic  in  Puntland, Jubaland and Somaliland administrative regions of Somalia. EFSVL Component: The project will addresshumanitarian needs of the IDPs, poor urban and returnees and will support cash and voucher assistance(CVA) to people affected by triple threats of conflict, drought and COVID 19 economically. This will be complemented to supportingLivelihood restoration for women groups affected  by  COVID  pandemic toenable  them to resume  or  establish  viable  livelihood options  intended  to provide  sustainable  livelihood  opportunities  for  affected  IDPs,  returnees  and  host  community  in  target 11regions of Somalia. This outcome will alleviate the sufferingof 6,780 people from extreme effects of COVID 19 i mpact and improve their food security situation. WASH Outcomes: A total of 8000people are expected to benefit from rehabilitation of three strategic water points  coupled  by  hygiene  and  promotion activities.  COVID  19  awareness  raising  will  be  conducted  for 60,000people  in  all  target  regions  of  the  project  with  the  aim  of  reducing  spread  of  this  pandemic. This outcome will benefita total of 60,000people. The project will benefita total of 60,000peopleand will be implemented in the same districts as DEC phase 1 in Puntland and Somaliland while the project target Kismayo district of Lower Juba region. Oxfam continues to work with WASDA in this project and implementationmodalitywill remain mixed approach.  The activities are in line with Oxfam\u2019s Humanitarian Strategy forSomalia and contributes to our Oxfam Coutnry Strategy (OSC)2020-2025.",

        "title": "CO-Drought & Sever Water Shortages Respo",
        "description": "2020 was one of the hardest years for Somalia in decades. Flooding, COVID-19 and recurring locust invasions heavily impacted on theeconomy and livelihoods of people. The government implemented measures to contain COVID-19, including the closure of schools, reduction of movement and other economic activities. The coastal areas of Puntland and Somaliland were also hit by cyclone Gati in November 2020, resulting in a sharp increase in humanitarian needs which many organizations - including Oxfam Somalia - responded to. While the performance of the 2020 Gu rain was near normal, the Deyr rain of 2020 has been categorized a complete failure due to the La Nina conditions. These developments triggered severe water shortages in many regions and districts in Somalia. Since October 2020, regional administrations, communities and other humanitarian agencies have been sending alerts about looming drought conditions in many parts of Somalia.Oxfam\u2019s feedback hotline continues to receive a high number of calls from people requesting immediate water interventions. These callers are mainly from the Sool, Sanaag and Togdheer regions. UNOCHA assessment findings indicate that over 50% of the communities in the assessed locations reported displacement of people due to water shortages, 85% raised major concerns on watershortages, and 14 out of 40 villages reported an increase in diarrheal cases. The price of water has already more than doubled. According to Oxfam\u2019s own market assessment, one barrel of water is currently being sold at an average of USD 4.5 per barrel, with some villages reporting over USD 7 per barrel. This is forcing the most vulnerable households to travel long distances to fetch water and/or opt for poor water quality and risk their lives. The most affected communities include IDPs and low-income host communities. Women and girls are at risk of protection-related risks as they travel in search of water.\nRegarding COVID-19, over 4,784 cases with over 130 fatalities were registered by the WHO in Somalia since the start of the pandemic, with many cases left undetected due to asymptomatic infections, low testing capacity and the stigmatisation of COVID-19 cases among the population. The second wave of the pandemic seems to have also hit the country as the number of cases started to increase in the last few months. The government of Somaliahas eased most of the restrictions in August 2020 and most of the public services have resumed. This increases the risk of vulnerability to COVID-19 and the shortages of water in many areas further restrict the communities' ability to frequently wash their hands with soap. This might create a favourable environment for COVID-19 to spread.\nThe Ministry of Water Development in Somaliland shareda request with all humanitarian agencies, indicating that over 196,848 people are in need of urgent water interventions and that many others also require quick rehabilitations of their water sources. Over 88% of the people in need are from the Sool, Sanaag, and Togdheer regions of Eastern Somaliland. In October 2020, Oxfam using the ECHO crisis modifier budget reached the most vulnerable 1,800 HH (10,800 people) in Sool, Sanaag, and Togdheer for 30 days with WASH interventions. Since then, we have continued to advocate for urgent interventions by sharing summary reports with the Somalia WASH cluster and presentations of the situation with cluster members. Utilising other existing resources, we are also working with the Ministry of Water Resources to rehabilitate boreholes that were identified as strategic wells by the government.",

        "description": "The first component is aimed at capacity building. At least 40 beneficiaries (at least 30% female) including fishermen and women, fishmongers will undergo a maximum of six months theoretical and practical training. Youth fishermen and women will be trained on safety at sea, fishing gear mending and repairs, safe fishing methods and fish preservation, cooperatives establishment and fish quality assurance. Fishmongers, who will mostly be women, will be trained in various topics including fish handling and preservation, fishprocessing, personal hygiene, value addition (processing, grading, and packaging) and small business management. Entrepreneurship will be an integral part of the courses in order to leverage the entrepreneurship capacity\nThe second component is aimed at supporting the establishment/ strengthening of fishery organizations. The target beneficiaries will be organized in Self Help Groups (SHGs). The SHG is a rights-based approach which views poverty as the denial of rights and poverty alleviation as a process of reclaiming one\u2019s rights. Given the multi-dimensional nature of poverty, the SHG Approach puts equal emphasis on the goals of economic, social andpolitical empowerment . Therefore, the established/strengthened SHGs will have the potential to empower small-scale fishers againstsome of the environmental and socioeconomic shocks such as fish catch shortfalls and revenues, sickness and death in their families, natural disasters and hunger. The 30 young fishermen will be organized intoat least 5 SHGs and will be trained/ oriented on the operations of the SHGs\nThe third component will support the distribution of fishing kits/gear to the SHGs including women fishmongers.Midway through the training, the project beneficiaries will be provided with fishing gears in their SGHs. Such gear may include boats and other necessary tools. On the other hand, women fishmongers, will have business start-up kits including refrigerators and basic fish processing tools. The fishing kits/ gear will be owned and managed jointly in the SHGs.\nThe fourth component will focus on learning and knowledge management through value chain research. In order to ensure systematic market mapping in the fishing sector, understand actors, market share, capacity gaps, and other relevant value chain information, the project will undertake a robust research on fish value chain. The research will aim to bring out suitable models to link small holders to input and output markets and improve the benefits that fishermen and women and other resource-poor value chain actors derive from the chain. Knowledge generated from the research will be disseminated to different relevant stakeholders in the sector. It will also act as a building block for future scaling efforts of the project. As Oxfam and the partner have both long-term livelihood strategies, the research finding would beused for future programing.",

It's evident that the Humanitarian Aid Dependency has largely affected the productivity of the Somali population. However, there's need to exhaust to what extent these will be addressed by our research questions for the Participatory Action Research (PAR) on Aid Humanitarian Aid dependency.\nIn 2019, nine Somali NGOs founded the Nexus platform that aims to shape the future in Somalia and Somaliland, by creating an enabling environment for Somali NGOs to have a leading role in the humanitarian system that puts the agency and self-reliance of communities at the center, through delivering a combination of Humanitarian Aid, Development, and Peace interventions. The Nexus coalition is led by nine Somali NGOs \u2013 African Development Solutions (ADESO), Centre for Peace and Democracy (CPD), Gargaar Relief and Development Organization (GREDO), Horn of Africa Voluntary Youth Committee (HAVOYOCO), KAALO, Save Somali Women and Children (SSWC), Social-Life and Agriculture Development Organisation (SADO), Taakulo Somaliland Community (TASCO), and WASDA.

This situation has increased the vulnerability of the communities as they have lost most of their livestock which was their main source oflivelihood. The situation is exacerbated by the fact that the two regions also continue to experience occasional inter clan fighting which isoften triggered by competition for available pasture and water resources. Drilling of the a boreholes will not only contribute to providing important water sources that can support the water needs of the communities during drought and harsh climatic conditions, but also contribute to reducing risk factors leading to conflict. It will offer an opportunity to the benefiting communities to have a chance for better access to potable water, reduce the incidents water related diseases and increase access for water for practicing frequent handwashing to prevent COVID-19.\nObjectives;\n\u2022 Provide sustainable water source for 5000 people and over 10,000 livestockheads in Sanaag Region.\nGroundwater Feasibility Study:\nA groundwater feasibility study will be conducted in three selected villagesof Sanaag region. the study will follow three approach method,\n1. Remote Sensing: Desk review using latest satellite imageries to selected best possible locations. This phase will focus on finding regional fractures carrying water from highland of Ethiopia to thelowland of Sanaag regions and from Sanaag mountains to low land areas.\n2. Geophysical Study: ground truthing work will be conducting using latest start of art geophysical technology at least three locations with spacing of 1000 -1500m. This location are those selected in first phase of the study work. Government and community engagement will be conducted to understand the local geology, possible impact of drilling on environment and stability of the communities.\nDrilling of the borehole\nBased on the groundwater feasibility study, the drilling work will be advertised through the local media. In order to avoid failures resulted from improper use of drilling equipment and selection of drilling method, the contractor will receive full copy of the study report and will be given a briefing on the drilling technology and technique recommended by the study team. Then, a payment by result approach will be used to contract drilling companies i.e. Oxfam/Taakulo will only pay if the borehole has water with discharge of above 2liter per second. Failureto get a contractor willing to commence drilling with such conduction, further meeting will be help between Oxfam and Taakulo to discuss best possible approach to increase value for money.\nSupervision and Monitoring:\nIn drilling works supervision and monitoring progress is critical step. Oxfam/Taakulo will have a site supervisor equipped with necessary materials for supervision including TDS Sensor to record water quality at each 1 meter, mud funnel to record the drilling mud viscosity and deeper to follow the depth of the drilling. The supervisor will provide daily update to both Oxfam/Taakulo team and will ensure all decision that affect drilling performance is consulted and agreed before action. TDS level will be recorded in monitoring tool provided and the result will be used for deciding the borehole casing arrangement. All materials that will be used for drilling will be inspected by the drilling supervisor and approve. In case a specialized chemical will be used for the drilling; the supervisor will request for all safety related certificate prior use of such chemicals.\nPost Drilling Construction:\nThis action will be decided right after the drilling is completed. Provision of submersible pump with cable and riser pipes, and construction of generator house, water distribution system for both animal and human and storage facilities will be included under this phase. Other grants, including ECHO 2021 and/or other internal grants will be used to finance this critical activity. Incase the borehole salinity is above an acceptable regional level i.e. 2500ppm, provision of desalination unit will be considered.",

Dar\u00fcber hinaus tr\u00e4gt das Projekt zur Stabilisierung der fragilen Sicherheitslage in den Projektst\u00e4dten S\u00fcdzentral-Somalias bei und f\u00f6rdert so die Friedenskonsolidierung vor Ort, wie im Marshallplan mit Afrika, \"Afrika und Europa - Neue Partnerschaft f\u00fcr Entwicklung, Frieden und Zukunft\" gefordert.

In Mogadischu wurden bereits Ma\u00dfnahmen im Bereich kommunale Infrastruktur identifiziert, f\u00fcr die St\u00e4dte Kismayo und Baidoa wurden bereits Vorstudien erstellt. Die einzelnen Ma\u00dfnahmen werden im Rahmen der Umsetzung festgelegt. \u0152 \u0152Zur Planung und Umsetzung der o.g. Ma\u00dfnahmen werden die Strukturen des Multi Partner Fund der Weltbank (MPF) genutzt, der zur Umsetzung der FZ-Mittel ein gesondertes Finanzierungsfenster f\u00fcr st\u00e4dtische Infrastruktur einrichtet. Zur F\u00f6rderung des von der Gebergemeinschaft angestrebten \"State-Building\" werden somalische Regierungsstrukturen soweit wie m\u00f6glich in die Planung, Gestaltung und Umsetzung der Ma\u00dfnahmen eingebunden. Auch die direkte Anbindung an den nationalen Entwicklungsplan ist damit sichergestellt. Zur Finanzierung des Vorhabens stellt das BMZ insgesamt 23,24 Mio. EUR aus FZ-Altmitteln und einer neuen bilateralen Zusage bereit. Angesichts der gro\u00dfen Bedarfe in den drei Projektst\u00e4dten erfolgte dar\u00fcber hinaus eine Vorratspr\u00fcfung in H\u00f6he von 50 Mio. EUR. \u0152",

While there are so far only seven laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Somalia (first case: 16 March 2020), it must be noted there are no testing facilities and tests are currently sent to South Africa. Results are received after two weeks. The country has only 15 intensive care unit beds and ranks 194th out of 195 in the Global Health Security Index. Over a third of Somalis do not have enough clean, safe water to meet their daily needs, let alone for more frequent preventive handwashing. It goes without saying that an outbreak of COVID-19 in Somalia would have a devastating impact on vulnerable communities who already suffer from drought, conflict and most recently, locust invasion. 6.3 million Somalis are food insecure, 2.1 million internally displaced.

Shaqodoon are currently in the process of completing the set-up of the helpline in Somaliland (with support from the current CAT Fund grant); to be launched by 11th April.

        "description": "On 2nd February 2020 the Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation of the Federal Government of Somalia has declared a national emergency (see press statement in attachment) in view of the current Desert Locust upsurge that poses a major threat to Somalia#sfragile food security situation. Food sources for people and their livestock are at risk. The Desert Locust swarms are uncommonly large and consume huge amounts of crops and forage.\nAccording to locust office of the Ministry of Agriculture and HADMA  latest report, there were huge swarm of Desert locust from Yemen that at the end September 2019 laid eggs in many locations in Somaliland. Despite controlefforts, a serious and widespread desert locust outbreak is threatening crops and pasture across Northern Somali regions. Accordingto experts, this is the worst outbreak in over 25 years in Somalia.\n\nThe situation has rapidly deteriorated in January 2020, as weather conditions have been unusually conductive to the spread of the pest. After cyclone Pawanmade landfall in early December 2019, flooding across the Horn of Africa created favourable breeding conditions for desert locusts. These conditions allow the breeding until June 2020 and could lead to 500 times more locust with the formation of large numbers of swarm as FAO indicated in their latest Appeal .\nDesert Locust breeding is ongoing in Somaliland, Puntland and Galmudug (Mudug). An estimated 70,000 hectares of land has been invaded by hoppers and breeding adults. Once they mature the locusts areexpected to migrate in swarms and move south towards the Ethiopian border area of Somaliland as well as Jubaland, Southwest State and Hirshabelle. These swarms will be at their most destructive stage and pose a very severe risk to Deyr season food and fodder production.\nMating adults, hoppers and swarms have been detected in Northwest Somalia (between Bulhar and Silil). Hoppers and immature adults were reported on the Northwest plateau and a swarm was detected between Burao and the Ethiopian border. Hopper bands were also reported south of Bossaso, south of Las Anod (near the Ethiopian border) and in Galmudug (near Galkayo). More swarms are likely to form along the Northwest coast and plateau, which may migrate to Djibouti, Eastern Ethiopia and SouthernSomalia.\nCrop and pastures have already been damaged in Somalia impacting negatively onagropastoral and pastoral households. In December 2019, it was reported that a huge number of desert locust (still at the stage of hopper bands) hatched in differentbreeding areas of Somaliland, such as coastal areas and farming land, posing a new devastating threat to crops and pasture lands.",

Whilst the deepening climate crisis exacerbates needs, Somalia and Somaliland are becoming increasingly stable, as persistent war gives way to erratic conflict and increasing capacity of government. Despite this, international actors face the obstacles of persistent issues of restricted access and highly challenging security circumstances. Local actors by contrast are able to transcend these issues and to guide interventions with nuanced local knowledge. This represents an opportunity to lead and deliver humanitarian aid locally. Somalia is one of the countries where a Joint Response to a protracted crisis under the DRA (SOMJR) is being implemented. With the changing context towards greater local leadership, the SOMJR already focuses on widening the space for local responders in humanitarian emergencies and decision-making fora. However, the Joint Response is fully led by INGOs, which inevitably creates unequal power dynamics that can negatively impact on the meaningful localization sought by local partners in Somalia. The protracted crisis situation, the long-standing presence of the DRA in Somalia, as well as the emergence of strong local humanitarian actors present the reality in which this PoC process can be carried out, and where an innovative pilot Joint Response focusing on meaningful localization would beworth exploring.\nThe Nexus Platform is an innovative response to the need for joined-up, localized responses at the triple nexus of humanitarian, development and peace programming: intervening to deliver coordinated outputs in all 3 spheres, which is essential in the Somali context, where climate shocks and conflict perpetually undermine humanitarian and development outcomes and deepen humanitarian crises.

        "description": "6.3 million people are currently in need of humanitarian assistance across Somalia and Somaliland, with 2.6 million internally displaced and an estimated 1 million displaced in nearby countries. Whilst the deepening climate crisis exacerbates needs, Somalia and Somaliland are becoming increasingly stable, as persistent war gives way to erratic conflict and increasing capacity of government. Despite this, international actors face the obstacles of persistent issues of restricted access and highly challenging security circumstances. Local actors by contrast are able to transcend these issues and to guide interventions with nuanced local knowledge. This represents an opportunity to lead and deliver humanitarian aid locally. Somalia is one of the countries where a Joint Response to a protracted crisis under the DRA (SOMJR) is being implemented. With the changing context towards greater local leadership, the SOMJR already focuses on widening the space for local responders in humanitarian emergencies and decision-making fora. However, the Joint Response is fully led by INGOs, which inevitably creates unequal power dynamics that can negatively impact on the meaningful localization sought by local partners in Somalia. The protracted crisis situation, the long-standing presence of the DRA in Somalia, as well as the emergence of strong local humanitarian actors present the reality in which this PoC process can be carried out, and where an innovative pilot Joint Response focusing on meaningful localization would beworth exploring.\nThe Nexus Platform is an innovative response to the need for joined-up, localized responses at the triple nexus of humanitarian, development and peace programming: intervening to deliver coordinated outputs in all 3 spheres, which is essential in the Somali context, where climate shocks and conflict perpetually undermine humanitarian and development outcomes and deepen humanitarian crises. Although specifically tackled in the Somali context here \u2013 climate shocks and conflict are global causes of ongoing humanitarian crises, making the Nexus Platform\u2019s approach pertinent to challenges at the triple nexus in parallel circumstances. Comprised of nine local NGOs (footprint 30m USD), Oxfam andSave the Children International and entirely locally led, the platform is operational across every region of Somalia and Somaliland. The platform is built upon principles of South-to-South learning and civil society strengthening, whereby expertise is openly exchanged between member organizations to build a consortium that is more than the sum of its parts. Humanitarian response is central tothe platform\u2019s nascent phase. The platform envisions both multisectoral humanitarian response and the development of an Anticipatory Response Mechanism \u2013 utilisingthe platform\u2019s breadth of local access to trigger pre-emptive early action. The platform urgently needs \u2013 and is invested in developing \u2013 a model for its humanitarian programme areas through a PoC process which will allow the platform to rethink conventional humanitarian approaches that are particularly open to question in contexts such as Somalia. The process used to develop this model will be additionally adapted for the development of the platform\u2019s ways of working in the development and peace spheres:whilst humanitarian actions are the platform\u2019s immediate priority in its current scope of work, programs exemplifying locally-led decision making are planned in community development, government and civil society strengthening, women\u2019s empowerment and other areas across the triple nexus and these will require their own guiding PoC processes.",

Frequent protection risks reported on the ground include (i) GBV, (ii) forced evictions, (iii) exposure to explosive hazards and (iv) child rights violations, such as child recruitment by armed groups and early marriage. Displacement increases the risk of family separation, and currently, there is an estimated caseload of 8,000 unaccompanied or separated children in Somalia. Furthermore, due to the loss of men\u2019s livelihoods, displaced women are increasingly taking on the role of breadwinners, which exposes them to the increased risk of domestic violence.\nIn a country where violence has been ongoing since 1991, persons with disabilities face extreme hurdles in being recognized, accessing resources and feeling valued in their community. This is particularly true for children and women with disabilities. Persons with disabilities in Somalia are side-lined in every aspect of humanitarian response and are being denied their economic, social and cultural rights. Reports show that persons with disabilities in Somalia are often denied access to water, food, sanitation and accommodation through lack of explicit inclusion\nAccordingly, Somalia marginalized minority communities are facing disaster human and humanitarian situation, extreme poverty and hunger which can lead is causing slow collective death, as members of these communities, especially women youth and children are suffer most from various forms human rights abuse, social and economic deprivation, including hunger and malnutrition, inadequate healthcare, limited access to education, and low self-esteem etc. Due to the above reasons, the minorities are the neediest group of people facing worst starvation, highest poverty rates, massive displacement, huge unemployment figures, highest illiteracy levels and horrific health and sanitation status. Unlike other clans from dominant groups, minorities lack international support due the prolonged Somali conflict which creates an environment where minority groups are vulnerable and abnormally displaced from their homes. Therefore, they suffer grievous human rights violations, which included extra judicial killings, appropriation of lands and properties, and forced displacement from their lands to IDP or refugee camps situated along the Somalia Ethiopia border. \nPopulation estimates indicate that of the 9.3 million people in Somalia, over 400,000 (4.3% of the population) are aged 60 or over.4 Nearly half the population 3.7 million people are now in crisis. Amongst them are approximately 160,000 people aged 60 and over (UNHCR) Practices and approaches that neither recognize their potential nor incorporate their needs place older men and women in a vulnerable situation. Older people\u2019s vulnerabilities stem from lack of opportunities, services and exclusion. There is also growing feminization of the older population as women outlive men leaving many widowed older women. However, gender bias and discrimination can place older women in a very vulnerable situation with few projects targeting older women. Whilst many of the challenges faced by older persons are also faced by other community members, for instance water storage, collection of firewood and limited opportunities for livelihoods, the implications of these challenges can be much greater for older men and women, due to age-related vulnerabilities.",

Interventions will be implemented jointly by the Danish Refugee Council (DRC) and Horn of Africa Peace Network (HAPEN), NoFYL and SEDHURO. DRC will implement both general protection and WASH components. While HAPEN will implement Shelter/NFI components, NoFYL will implement CCCM and HLP components while SEDHURO will carry out the Child Protection component. DRC and HAPEN had originally entered into a teaming agreement for the implementation of project but with the approval of NoFYL and SEDHURO as implementation partners, active collaboration and coordination with the two organizations will be explored. The integrated approach by the 4 organizations, will create synergies, utilize agency expertise and community networks to access and provide adequate and quality services to the most vulnerable members of the community. \n\n\nThe proposed DRC intervention is designed to contribute to the 2021 Somalia Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) and the efforts to address the needs of most vulnerable displacement affected communities with a focus on Belet Xaawo district, Gedo region which is a key location targeted by SHF allocation strategy in 2021. The intervention will promote Protection as a central part of programming and will incorporate continuous awareness creation, analysis of protection risks, training amp follow up for effective implementation in line with the Centrality of Protection Strategy 2020-2021 adopted by the HCT in June 2020. Specifically, the project will strengthen the protection of most vulnerable girls, boys, women and men affected by climatic shocks, conflict and COVID-19 by reducing risks and vulnerabilities and increasing community capacities. It will also address needs exacerbated by the ongoing pre-drought conditions as a result of poor rainfall, impact of floods in 2020 and the ongoing locust infestation. The project will employ participatory and community-based and right based approaches as well as age, gender, diversity and inclusion to ensure vulnerable communities receive adequate and quality responses. Key interventions will include protection monitoring and assessments, strengthening of existing referral pathways. Community based mechanisms will be strengthened to prevent and respond to protection concerns. \n\n\nWASH activities will focus on both immediate and sustainable intervention that include improved access to safe water. DRC will carry out rehabilitation and/or extension of existing water infrastructures, construction of new water infrastructures, water trucking, establishment of gender balanced water management committees, appropriate operation and maintenance and as well strengthen women leadership and participation in WASH projects, installation of new sanitation facilities (culture sensitive and addressing specific needs of different sex and disabled groups) in settlements hosting newly displaced population and hygiene promotion campaigns focusing on hand washing with soap and hygiene kits distribution, including female specific hygiene items (sanitary clothes, etc.)\nThe project will target to reach 30,000 individuals\u2019 people (7000 men, 8000, women, 7000 boys, 8000 girls).",

Besides construction of 50 Transitional Shelters, 575 HHs will also be supported in Baidoa through provision of locally purchased Non-Food Items (NFIs) through cash, provision of 575 Emergency Shelter Kits (ESKs) to the same HHs through cash, settlement (re)planning training to reduce congestion, overcrowding and provide dignified living to beneficiaries. \n\nIn order to reduce congestion and overcrowding, NRC will engage local community leaders to select beneficiaries in Baidoa and after selection use an electronic mobile data collection tool called 'Kobo Tool box' to register all targeted beneficiaries, 20% of the selected beneficiaries will be poor host community members in line with 'Do No Harm' principals. Similarly, 15% of the targeted person will be those with disabilities (PWDs) will also be selected from the targeted areas. Beneficiaries will be provided with cash ($100 per each HH in single installment) for NFIs while $213 (80% or $170 as the first installment and remaining 20% or $43 as the second installment) for Emergency Shelter Kits. In order to enable a holistic response and deliver greater impact, each household will benefit from both the NFIs and ESKs provision. NRC will acquire the services of local telecom company Hormuud Telecom for the cash transfers and with this adhere to strict beneficiary verification protocols which in this case will also include beneficiary verification by the service provider through their mobile Identities before disbursement of the cash. This beneficiary list will include the names of the selected beneficiaries, mobile number, token numbers, location of residence and gender. It is only upon verification of the beneficiary details as submitted by NRC that the service provider shall disburse. Beneficiaries whose personal details are not approved will go through a second round of verification process. \n\n80% of the targeted beneficiaries will be IDPS while 20% will be host community members . Beneficiary selection criteria that considers the needs of Extremely Vulnerable Individuals (EVIs) including female and single-headed HHs, orphans, chronically ill, aged and child-headed households will be applied . This criteria will be refined further and agreed upon with community leaders at inception to ensure that only those that are in real need receive aid. Gender will be mainstreamed at each and every stage of the action with specific attention given to the multiple and diversified needs of women, men, boys and girls. The project is designed to ensure that all potential beneficiaries in the location of action have equal opportunity to access resources and training through the complete application of a rights and needs only based approach. Monitoring and evaluation of all components will be informed by refined and easy to use monitoring and evaluation (MampE) tools, that disaggregate data according to age, gender and diversity. Thus, in total, 625 HHs (575 through ESK, 575 through NFIs and 50 HH through Transitional Shelters) or 3,750 individuals (50% females) will be assisted in Baidoa through this project. A Post Distribution Monitoring (PDM) exercise will be conducted after 6 weeks of NFIs and ESKs distribution to determine use of cash, impact of the response and to generate lessons learned for future programming. Similarly, for the transitional shelters, a post construction monitoring exercise will be conducted after 3 month of the construction completion.",

The camps have been selected on the basis of need, high proportion of the newly arrived, lack of similar support and accessibility. The needs of the beneficiaries have been identified through a joint rapid needs assessment conducted by HAPEN and DRC in March 2021.\n\nThe target population (women, girls, men, boys, elderly and people with disabilities) are living in small makeshift structures made of sub-standard materials that compromise their privacy, physical security and protection from weather extremes. The families lack adequate access to NFIs, having lost them during displacement.\n\nHAPEN will distribute Emergency Shelter Kits (ESKs) and non-food items (NFI) kits to 2333 households, including 230 host households who are equally vulnerable in the interest of Do-No Harm principle and in support of reintegration. An owner-driven approach in the construction of shelters where beneficiaries are assisted and capacitated to undertake the construction. The process will enable them to undertake basic repairs using local materials or rebuild their shelters in future, thus contributing to sustainability of the benefits beyond the project period. On monitoring, Post Distribution Monitoring (PDM) and Post Construction Monitoring (PCM) will be conducted after distribution of NFIs and ESKs respectively. The exercises will provide beneficiary feedback on project effectiveness and will target 90% of the beneficiaries to ensure proper representation and accuracy.\n\nTo ensure accountability, HAPEN will establish community response and feedback mechanisms (CRFM) in the targeted sites. This will be comprised of a CRFM desk and a hotline to offer a channel for beneficiaries to register concerns. \n\nHAPEN will work closely with local administration to plan distribution points, schedules and instill order during the exercises to minimize protection risks. The timing and locations of all distributions will put the safety of women, girls, boys, elderly, disabled and those with limited mobility into consideration. Distribution exercises will be done within reasonable daylight hours. Distances to distribution sites and facilities provided by the project will be minimal and safe. It will be made clear that support provided by the project will be at no cost to the beneficiaries, hence no favours should be solicited from beneficiaries. COVID-19 prevention measures will be observed at all points where project requires beneficiaries, leaders or partners to gather. In general, the project will address protection risks and inclusion of women, disabled and minorities at all stages.\n\nCommunity structures including project community committees will play key roles in decision making, implementation and monitoring of activities and will be comprised of men, women and representatives of the disabled and the minority. \n\nIn particular, this project will closely coordinate and harmonize with Protection, WASH, CCCM and Housing, Land amp Property (HLP)  interventions to be implemented by other partners (DRC, SEDHURO and  NOFYL)  in the same district or camps and in general all other initiatives in the district to ensure complementarity.

The target group will be carefully selected from protracted and newly arrived IDPs in overcrowded settlements at-risk of Covid 19 outbreak. Special priority will be accorded to households in deplorable shelter conditions, the evicted, those who have lost household items and shelter due to disasters, persons with disabilities, female headed households and people from marginalized groups. \n\nUnder the proposed initiative, 1,120 kit-based Non-Food Items (NFIs) will be distributed to 1,120 households (6,720 persons) in Banadir. In-line with shelter cluster standards, each NFI kits will contain core items such as 1 Plastic Sheet, 3 Blankets, 2 Sleeping Mats, 1 Kitchen Set, 1 double Mosquito Net, 1 Solar lamp and 2 Jerrycan with the capacity of 10 liters each. Disbursement of relief items will be need-based, and will be decided in close coordination with the Shelter Cluster to ensure that available stocks are used to respond to crisis and that activities contribute to the attainment of cluster strategic objectives. In addition to NFIs, 1,120 registered households (6,720 will also receive emergency shelters. To ensure complementarity, the same group who received the NFIs will receive the emergency shelters. Site planning will be an integral part of the shelter development process, thus ensuring that adequate separation between individual households exist to provide all-weather access to individual dwellings and facilities. Before construction of emergency shelters, AVORD will closely coordinate with district officials and relevant line ministries at state and national levels to secure land tenure for a minimum of 3 years.   \n\nFull beneficiary details including name, settlement and contact information will be captured to facilitate monitoring activities and ensure that aid is given to those in need. A Post Distribution Monitoring Exercise (PDM) will be conducted to assess the effectiveness of the response and document lessons learnt. \n\nIn the delivery of the proposed package, AVORD will seek integration with own interventions in Banadir where AVORD is implementing other programs, and with other humanitarian partners to ensure complementarity, value for money and efficiency of the response.",

        "description": "Somalia is currently facing a severe water shortage following the poor performance of 2020 short rains (Deyr) and the subsequent abnormally high temperatures, heightening fears of deepening humanitarian crisis in 2021. 2020 Deyr season rainfall was characterized by delays and erratic distribution. Overall, the rainfall was below average in most parts of the country with adverse impact on replenishment of water sources.\n\n4.6 million people remain in need of humanitarian WASH assistance in Somalia in 2021 with 2.5 million of them facing acute need of water and sanitation services (FSNAU Technical Release, February 2021). Poor performance of short rains (Oct-Dec) caused water shortages in Sool, Sanaag and South Central Somalia causing displacement of pastoral communities. Of the people in need and highly vulnerable, a large percentage are children, women and the elderly, who critically lack access to clean water and are acutely at risk of gender-related violence and high morbidity and mortality due to water-borne disease outbreaks. Many households lack access to adequate sanitation leading to frequent open defecation while safety of people, particularly women and children to access latrines and water points remains a serious concern and a serious risk for exposure to violence.\n\nACTED will therefore respond to this augmented risks and crisis through a WASH and market based intervention in Lascanod district, Sool region. Through this intervention, ACTED will reach a total of 3,001 households (18,010 individuals) in the proposed area of intervention. In order to create synergies and ensure sequencing, layering and integrating of programming, ACTED will complement the proposed intervention with a current USAID-BHA integrated programme in the target areas. \n\nACTED will respond to the aggravated risk through a comprehensive WASH intervention in eight hard to reach villages in Lascanod district, Sool region. This intervention will serve a total of 3,001 households (18,010 individuals). ACTED intends to construct one new borehole in Dhabansar village,  while inTuulo-samakaab ACTED will rehabilitate one borehole. Additionally, targeting the construction of 40 flood-resistant latrines with hand washing stations in Lascanod, district. 30% of the total target latrines to be constructed will be completed through the market based scheme in seeking to enhance WASH market systems and increase the purchasing power of the affected population. Regarding hygiene, ACTED intends to include hygiene promotion sessions and hygiene kit distribution through a voucher system. The full suite of activities aims to meet both the acute and long-term needs of the vulnerable IDP communities, whilst establishing relationships with the target communities for continued maintenance and operation of these assets.",

        "description": "The humanitarian situation in Somalia is deteriorating due to the devastating impact of flooding, desert locust infestation, the COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing conflict About 5.9 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance, an increase from the 5.2 million reported in 2020. Up to 2.7 million people are expected to be in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or worse and will face acute food insecurity through mid-2021. An estimated 840,000 children under the age of five are acutely malnourished, 143,000 of them severely and at risk of death. According to Somalia HNO for 2021 the protracted crisis in Somalia, compounded by COVID-19, floods and droughts, has resulted in massive challenges in meeting the WASH needs of the Somali population. According to the JMCNA, approximately 8.9 million people are affected by poor WASH conditions. For 2021, it is estimated that 4.6 million people are in catastrophic (10 per cent), severe (9 per cent) or extreme (18 per cent) need of humanitarian WASH assistance. The 10 per cent of households in catastrophic need mainly face a lack of access to water both in terms of quality and quantity, accompanied by a lack of access to functional sanitation. It is also a cause of relapse for acute diarrheal diseases when treated patients and children return to their communities with limited safe water and sanitation coverage, resulting in limited sustainability of health programs.\nAccording to assessment conducted by BTSC in Nov,2020 findings revealed that majority of the households (63.3%) use unsafe water from a water catchment or a dam as their primary source for drinking water and the said dam has dried up and the cost of 200 litters of water is currently costing between $3-$4 US Dollars which is not affordable to the drought affected communities. Additionally, 43.5% of sampled households do not treat drinking water. The assessment also revealed that only 45% of the resident do have access to latrines and 98% of those latrines are not accessible to people with disabilities. only 37.5% of the assessed families reported to have access to soap.\nIn the context mentioned above GRRN will implement a WASH cluster-specific intervention aiming (1)Improve access to safe water through water trucking to 10,000 drought affected population in priority sites /settlements/ communities targeting in Bay(Burhakaba). Rehabilitation and/or extension of existing water infrastructures one borehole and 6 shallow wells with hand pump. (2) Construction of water infrastructures including construction of tanks and distribution networks, hybrid solar water pumping system in Burhakaba Borehole (Site selection should aim at reducing the risk of violence against women and children accessing water sources through their participation in discussions). (3)Establishment of gender balanced water management committees for ensuring continuity` of services, appropriate operation and maintenance and as well strengthen women leadership and participation in WASH projects.(4) construction of 60 latrines in settlements (culture sensitive and addressing specific needs of different sex and disabled groups) hosting new displaced population. (5) Hygiene promotion campaigns focusing on hand washing with soap and 1,500 hygiene kits distribution, including female specific hygiene items (sanitary clothes) accompanied by robust hygiene promotion activities. GRRN WASH technical designs adhere to SPHERE standards/Somalia WASH cluster guidelines, mainstreaming protection and disability, gender considerations per IASC guidelines for GBV Interventions in Humanitarian settings, WASH Chapter as well as the environmental protection considerations and securing access to the elderly and those with special needs as per Handicap International Guidelines. The total beneficiaries targeted in this project are 14,000(6,720 women, 4,480 men, 1,680 girls and 1,120 boys) in Burhakaba.",

        "description": "In 2020, Somalia had been hit by Multiple threats from Covid-19, locusts, conflict, insecurity, forced evictions, droughts, and flooding. The number of people in need has consistently increased over the last three years, from 4.2 million in 2019 to 5.2 million in 2020 and 5.9 million in 2021 according to the CCCM cluster Acaps review. This is further reflected in the number of displaced people in 2020/2021. 47% of the population of 12.3 million needs some form of humanitarian assistance, including 2.7 million internally displaced persons (IDPs), with an additional half a million displaced on average per year as a result of climatic conditions and conflict. Most displacement-affected persons face multiple or recurrent displacements, with a majority of IDPs having been displaced at least five times previously and very few return to areas of origin. Post-Gu IPC analysis conducted in September 2020 by FEWSNET and partners, indicates that an estimated 1.7 million people are anticipated to be in Crisis (IPC Phase 3), with 0.4 million persons experiencing an emergency (IPC Phase 4). An additional 3.0 million persons are expected to be Stressed (IPC Phase 2), with the current conditions projected to remain unchanged by end of 2020. Projections running into 2021, through May, predict continued Stressed (IPC 2) and Crisis (IPC 3) outcomes to persevere, largely due to continued struggles of affected households to overcome shocks. Households in IDP areas in the Banadir region are facing food consumption gaps and are classified as Crisis (IPC Phase 3), driven by the high cost of living and limited income-earning opportunities. This notwithstanding, the sustained and large-scale humanitarian coordination is preventing more severe outcomes in many regions across Somalia. Camp coordination and camp management is a relatively a concept that\u2019s limited within the region and it is of utmost importance that key stakeholders i.e. government officials and humanitarian actors, be sensitized to this concept. \n\nSCC will implement these activities in 20 IDP sites in Kahda district of Banadir region with over 30,000HHs as per the latest detailed site assessment (DSA), targeting a largely underserved area. Approximately 36000 IDPs (6000 households) will benefit from this proposed intervention, in addition to the community working in these sites including local authorities, clusters, and other NGOs. These numbers might vary due to external factors, which might attract more IDPs, excessive flooding, or conflict with the landowners or the authorities, which may cause IDPs to flee to other areas. Gender will be mainstreamed into the project through the specific consideration of the different needs of women, men, boys, and girls during the design of activities. The project will ensure that all participants have equal access to resources and training. Monitoring and evaluation will be based on gender, age, and diversity dis-segregated data. SCC will implement this intervention in the Kahda district of Banadir region targeting 6000 HHs. Kaxda District is one of the IDP major hubs in Mogadishu that hosts the largest number of IDPs. Throughout the project, the needs of women, girls, men, and boys of all ages will be addressed throughout the planning, implementation and monitoring, and evaluation of the activities. Through regular site monitoring, needs and gaps will be reported and shared with partners and all stakeholders. Particular attention regarding needs will be paid to women and girls who also have to contend with GBV and protection concerns within camp settings. Through this project, SCC will also address the current and newly identified needs by setting up camp coordination structures at the national and, where necessary, regional or district levels, facilitating and supporting the establishment of effective coordination and management in IDP sites while respecting national context and authorities.",

        "description": "This project seeks to enhance the living conditions and access to service for estimated 36,000 IDP persons from 40 settlements in Kahda and Daynile districts of Benadir. This will be achieved through a number of interrelated and complementary activities including enhancing the capacity of camp governance structures and site-level committees to promote information-sharing and foster system-wide coordination among service providers. Key program activities also include organizing site-level coordination meetings among service providers and local authorities to highlight priority needs and challenges, mitigate protection risks and ensure efficient use of existing referral pathways. 10 site-level mobilizers, each serving as a focal point for 4 sites, will be hired from target IDPs to circulate key messages, report on gaps, conduct service mapping, needs and new arrivals, conduct site monitoring and take shelter-level CFM complaints in close coordination with the CCCM cluster and other partners to effectively address vulnerabilities and maximize efficiency of the humanitarian response. \n\nSite maintenance committees and IDPs in target settlements will be equipped with a range of site maintenance tools and supplies before engaging in cash-for-work schemes through which community-led site upkeep and maintenance activities will be carried out. In the selection of cash-for-work beneficiaries, AVORD will adapt a systematic approach with a clear criterion to prioritize the most vulnerable households including the marginalized, single headed-households, large families and/or families with children under the age of 5, women at risk as identified by protection officers and those with special needs. Data collected to inform beneficiary selection will be segregated by gender to ensure that no group is left-out. List of beneficiaries along with their contact numbers will be availed to SHF and other actors responding in the area to avoid overlap. \n\nThe effectiveness of the aid package will be evaluated through monitoring of activities thus ensuring that beneficiaries access their services safely and in a dignified manner. Protection will be mainstreamed throughout project duration by closely coordinating with other partners operating Sexual and Gender Based Violence (SGBV) crisis centers and facilitating principled referrals where necessary. An elaborate feedback and complaint mechanism will be setup to ensure accountability to the affected population. Target sites will be prioritized based on vulnerability such as congestion levels, proportion of minority groups, potential exposure to protection risks and overall living conditions. AVORD will utilize cluster tools such as the IDP site risk map or DSA data in the process of site selection. A site-level Complaint and Feedback Mechanism (CFM) will be developed and the project team will ensure that the system is accessible for all populations and that the mechanism is clearly understood and supported by the community.\n\nThe present proposal will complement an interagency program currently being implemented by AVORD and other partners in Banadir to provide WASH and awareness raising services to reduce Covid 19 transmission. Synergies will be developed with these activities to ensure complementarity, value for money and efficiency of the resources.",

These needs have affected attendance and retention of learners in the 15 targeted schools. The main gaps in delivery of quality education services in the 15 schools include limited capacity of the Ministry of Education to provide the required education services due to budgetary constraints lack of intervention by other education partners due to the remoteness of the school that contributes to inaccessibility and security challenges to operate in these areas recurrent drought and intermittent conflict leading to loss of livelihoods for the communities in the targeted locations. The project will target to directly reach 2,315 learners out of which 1,266 boys and 1,049 are girls, 30 teachers translating to 2 teachers plus 1 head teacher per school, 30 community hygiene promoters and indirectly reach 45 CEC members. Education specific activities will include the provision of education supplies, emergency take-away food rations for students to meet their food and energy needs, emergency teacher incentives to motivate teachers to stay in the schools, and sanitary kits for adolescent girls to encourage their regular attendance at school. Specific WASH activities will include increasing schools\u2019 water storage capacity through the provision of PVC storage tanks, water trucking to the schools to ensure a regular supply of water to the schools during drought, construction and rehabilitation of latrines, and improving hygiene practices among children through engagement with community hygiene promoters (CHPs). To ensure inclusion of students with disabilities, child, gender and disability friendly latrines will be constructed with accessibility ramps and door sizes made within the required inclusion standards to enable access by students with disabilities to these facilities. CISP will coordinate a back-to-school campaign with CECs and religious leaders to encourage school enrollment with an emphasis on children affected by drought and displacement. To ensure centrality of protection in the schools, CISP will assess the existing child protection mechanisms at the start of the project, appoint and train protection focal points in the schools to strengthen feedback and reporting mechanisms to address protection concerns in the schools., Through engagement with ministry officials such as Ministry of Education Culture and Higher Education  MoECHE Gender Focal Points,  the Ministry of Women and Human rights Development MoWHRD Regional Child Protection Coordinator and CECs, CISP will leverage the agency's apparatus and community assets to raise awareness among children on child protection and the established mechanisms which will serve to strengthen child protection in schools.",

Further, the intervention proposes to support learner retention, improve learning environment and ensure safety of learners. The intervention has been designed to meet the needs of vulnerable girls, women, boys and men, IDPs and host communities in the three target districts (Luuq, Belethawa and Dolow). In ensuring centrality of protection, the program has been designed to enhance awareness/dissemination of child protection amp safeguarding principles with targeted girls and boys through establishment of leadership networks/clubs/platforms in targeted public schools in Gedo region. The intervention has based a big bulk of its outputs towards supporting IDP children (70%) and children from vulnerable host communities to enroll in permanent functional schools within Gedo, to ensure sustainability. The intervention is designed to build on gains made by the ongoing Education Cannot Wait (ECW) project as well as DFID funded Leave No Girl Behind (LNGB) which targets the same schools and locations, and to leverage and complement on other sectoral interventions in the same schools (WASH, Protection, Health), and will adopt an integrated approach that will focus on drought, protection, COVID-19 prevention and control, and life-saving interventions. In order to ensure access to safe and protective learning environment for vulnerable learners, the intervention shall among other key interventions: construct/rehabilitate TLS, provide safe drinking water hygiene promotion in schools (including COVID-19 prevention and control messaging), distribute sanitary kits to girls, establish school WASH facilities based on need, distribute TLM, pay emergency teacher incentives, provision of school feeding program as well as implementation of child protection activities in line with the education and child protection integrated response framework. The intervention will be implemented in a total of eighteen (18) schools in Gedo Region. The final list of schools will be agreed upon together with the Gedo Education Cluster Focal Point (HIRDA) to ensure that only the most needy drought-affected schools are supported. A draft list of the schools (including locations) to be supported is provided in the documents section.",

The targeted schools are either closed or at the brink of closure due to the impact of the deteriorating drought conditions in the target locations. The proposed intervention aims to provide lifesaving humanitarian assistance to drought-affected school children whereby the proposed project will be targeting to improve access to quality education and increase access to critical WASH inputs for the lifesaving of the affected school children in (10) Ten schools (three in xafuun and Seven in Bosaso )Hanaqad IDP Daryeel Primary School, Gargaar IDP Primary, Bilaal IDP Primary School, Bandarqasim IDP Primary School, often primary, Daryeel IDP Primary School, Yaasiin IDP Primary School, Foocaar Primary School Hadha Primary School, Barmadoobe Primary Schools are among the schools that are most affected by Drought and Cyclone Gati in Bosaso and Xaafun districts bari region of Puntland State of Somalia.\nThese Programme specific activities will include the provision of educational supplies and equipment including school furniture\u2019s for refurbished and constructed classrooms based on the minimum standards of education cluster School feeding program for Most vulnerable pupils to meet student\u2019s minimum caloric needs emergency teacher incentives to motivate teachers rehabilitations of learning spaces that are affected by the cyclone, sanitary kits for adolescent girls to encourage their regular attendance at school and establishment of school WASH facilities, etc... \nSpecific WASH activities in schools will include increasing schools\u2019 water storage capacity through the provision and installation of PVC water storage tanks, Water tracking for affected schools rehabilitation of latrines, and construction of Child- and gender-friendly latrines in the affected schools, Provision of Aqua tabs, where necessary, rehabilitated to minimize disruptions in learning for girls and boys. To ensure water availability in targeted schools, a joint assessment along with Community Education Committees (CEC) will be conducted in schools to find a sustainable solution for water availability but currently, PMWDO will conduct a water trucking for 3 months for 3,300(1720 boys and 1580 girls) school children in IDP and affected schools.\nThe proposed project will be complemented with other ongoing PMWDO education interventions in the region, as well as other wider emergency responses. PMWDO is currently implementing a UNICEF-funded \u201cEducating girls with disabilities\u201d in the Puntland State of Somalia but not in the target location for this project. This proposed project will not only complement but also retain children in the affected target locations to have access to continued learning otherwise children would have displaced to where there is an ongoing intervention which could create a burden on the ongoing response. The proposed response is therefore meant to link up to reach to school being supported under this program to enable the children to continue access education support. The project will also extend to cover other schools where high EIE needs have been established but are not covered by PMWDO or any other organization. PMWDO will rehabilitate classrooms and other affected infrastructure like Latrines. The project also envisages addressing the immediate needs of the students through the distribution of scholastic materials/TLM including learning kits, curriculum books, and recreational materials. The project will guarantee gender mainstreaming, and equity as 1200 girls will be supported with dignity kits and sanitary pads. Using the reflective circles' approach PMWDO will train 32 teachers (18 males and 14 female) teachers and the students on Education in Emergency contents and life skills development.",

        "description": "The NGO safety program was established in 2004 to support NGOs operating in Somalia in terms of staff safety. In this complex context, NGOs face strong challenges related to access and security, including: a lack of understanding of the context difficulty to access and to verify information a lack of information sharing a lack of security coordination and harmonized security practices poor security awareness of staff and a lack of training opportunities. This safety platform is managed since April 2015 by INSO\n\nIn response to, and following the guidance of an Advisory Board (which is composed of 4 INGOs: Halo Trust, IRC, INTERSOS, FCA and 1 LNGO SYDAVO), the project focuses on two main pillars of action which can be summarized as Information, Analysis and Advice, and Preparedness and Response. The two pillars are strongly interconnected: NGOs need accurate and timely security information to base their decisions on, while they need the proper safety training and preparation to organize and take relevant security decisions. Finally, in case an incident takes place, NGOs receive adequate support. Information is shared on adhoc basis daily or several time a day as alerts if the security incident requires the immediate action of NGOs and scheduled products are sent every week, every fortnight and every quarter\nThrough INSO\u2019s own network of Deputy Safety Advisors and Safety Advisor assistants (all INSO staff have their own network to source information as they are very close to the community and in contact with a wide range of local actors), NGO reports, collaboration with other security actors and media follow up, INSO collects, verifies, compiles and analyses security incidents. Besides, since 2010, the project has developed a database of more than 57,000 incidents that constitutes a unique tool for data analysis. The INSO Training Team runs training programs which targets both individual safety and management of the organization's security. Finally, INSO field teams help NGOs on the ground to deal with daily security incidents, such as arrests, accidents and threats, while the INSO senior management team can provide support to critical incidents such as kidnappings, abductions and medical evacuations. The extent of INSO involvement is determined by the NGO who requests our services.\n\nDue to the peculiar mandate and mission of INSO, its Hargeisa office has a dual role, both as coordination hub and implementer of core INSO activities (such as roundtables, individual briefings, and production of maps and reports). Likewise, senior management (including the Country Director) are highly involved in the direct delivery of our services: they are not just managers but also direct implementers in their role as advisors to other NGOs.\nThe project budget leans heavily in HR costs because the project\u2019s core product is knowledge. That\u2019s in essence what INSO\u2019s beneficiaries receive. When the main output of an organization is information, the organization core cost is HR \u2013 same as e.g. an online newspaper or a management consulting firm.",

        "description": "Critical humanitarian needs persist in Somalia across the different livelihood groups whose vulnerabilities continue to worsen due to the devastating impact of flooding, desert locust infestation, COVID-19 pandemic and escalating conflict. The poor Deyr rains (October to December 2020) led to the inadequate pasture for livestock, water shortage and below average crop production. The deteriorating food security outlook combined with the worsening malnutrition appeals for a rapid, well-targeted and coordinated scale up of responses to save lives and recovery of livelihoods assets. The project aims to improve immediate access to food while restoring livelihood assets related to food and income sources that have been impacted by water shortages through conditional cash transfers to enhance livelihood opportunities and rehabilitation of water infrastructures and provision of fodder seeds (Sudan grass) in agro-pastoral and pastoral villages in Belet-Hawa district, Gedo region. \nThe project will target 815 vulnerable drought affected agro-pastoral and pastoral households among women, men, boys, girls, including female headed households who are classified under IPC 3 amp 4. The detrimental effects of the current shocks have severely and directly affected rural communities whose sources of food, income and water are diminishing and increasingly at risk leading to household food insecurity, increase in debt levels among poor households and a severe reduction in access to safe water for both domestic and livestock use. Additionally, the affected households rely on food purchase from local markets, have weak purchasing power due to limited income and lack access to credit services due to cumulative debts. \nCOOPI prioritizes respect for the rights, dignity and safety of the people affected by crisis and is committed to taking account of, giving account to, and being held to account by the populations benefiting from the intervention. During implementation process, target communities, especially women, girls and the disabled will be included in community representative committees and decision making processes In selection of beneficiaries, registrations, verifications and monitoring exercises so as ensure that the most marginalized and vulnerable are represented and have influence. The project will be guided by the principles of DO NO HARM, ensuring safety and dignity of target population is upheld and at the same time providing for accountability, participation and empowerment. In order to improve household immediate access to food, conditional cash transfer will be provided to 815 affected household including girls, pregnant and lactating women, boys and men to enable them immediately access food, water, healthcare, and other basic services.\nTo restore livelihood assets of households, 815 beneficiaries will engage in cash for work activities construction and/or rehabilitation of water catchments and water harvesting structures (soil bunds), 150 households among the CFW beneficiaries will also be provided with fodder seeds (Sudan grass) in the areas where soil bunds structures have been constructed to regenerate pasture to ensure availability of fodder for livestock. This activity aims at restoring livestock assets of the communities and envisages reducing workload and stress on women and girls who are responsible for feeding livestock. In addition, gender based violence and exploitation malpractices associated with in search of livestock feeds and water for long distances will be mitigated through the proposed activity. In summary the following activities will be carried out:\n1. Provide conditional cash transfer to 815 households in Belet-Hawa district to increase household purchasing power and rehabilitate livelihood assets and water sources.\n2. Support to fodder production through provision of Sudan grass seeds) for 150 affected households in Belet-Hawa district.",

        "description": "The overall objective of the proposed project is to directly improve immediate access to food for at least 279 households (1,953 individuals considering a household size of 7 individuals) including 239 households benefiting from conditional cash transfers and 40 households benefiting from fodder production and management training and seeds support. \n\nTo achieve the overall objective, the project offers to provide conditional cash transfers for improved access to food, rehabilitate water infrastructure and other communal livelihood assets such as rangelands, reseeding of the rehabilitated rangelands and construction of fodder shades. The project will also train selected beneficiaries in improved fodder production and management. The project directly targets mostly under-served individuals and living in hard to reach areas in 5 villages including Badhi Galis Satellite, Bixin, Masle in Ceel Afweyn district and Rag Caddeye, Marwade in Ceerigaabo district all in Sanag region. The target beneficiaries will mainly include women, men, persons with disability, children and the elderly and other vulnerable groups broadly categorized as host communities and IDPs. The project duration is 7 months to allow families to recover from adverse weather conditions. \n\nSpecifically, 239 households (HH) including 235 workers and 4 foremen will receive conditional Cash Transfers. Each of the 235 household/ beneficiary will receive $126 for 3 months/ rounds, while the 4 foremen will be recruited for 54 days and paid a daily rate of $10. The cash transfers empower people with choice to address their essential and individual food needs, while also helping to boost local markets. Another reason for Candlelight to apply cash transfer are the reduced facilitation costs, as mobile transfers do require less administrative costs. The cash values to be transferred on a monthly basis are provided by the Cash Working Group (CWG) Somalia based on minimum expenditure basket (MEB) as per region across Somalia. A PDM will be conducted after the first round of cash transfer to determine level of satisfaction of the beneficiaries. A local telephone company (Telesom) with extensive experience of conducting cash transfer to beneficiaries in remote areas will be commissioned to conduct monthly cash transfers to beneficiaries mobile phones. The beneficiaries who may not know how to use the services will be trained on how to use it. \n\nFurthermore, at least 40 households from Bali Gelis and Bixin will be trained in improved fodder production and management and provided with fodder seedlings. In the same villages, 2 fodder shades will be constructed to improve fodder storage. \n\nAlso, 2 berkads will be constructed in 2 villages including Rag Caddeye and Marwade in Ceerigaabo district and 2 dams will be rehabilitated in Rag Caddeye and Masle villages through conditional cash transfer in order to improve community access to water for household and livestock use through rehabilitated water infrastructure. Water catchments (rangelands) will be rehabilitated and reseeded to increase availability of fodder for the animals. \n\nCandlelight has rolled out a mobile phone/ technology beneficiary feedback and complaints mechanism (\u201cfeedback loops\u201d) with a tool free and easy to remember telephone number. This will enable beneficiaries to provide feedback and complaints but as well receive feedback from Candlelight.",

The intervention aims to ensure that lives are saved and human suffering is reduced through provision of food security production inputs to targeted beneficiaries in order to ensure immediate access to inputs and subsequently to food for the most vulnerable populations. Due to the Current biting  droughts , this project  will target a total of 650 HHs approximately 3,900(585 men, 975women, 1,170 boys and 1,170 girls in drought affected people in Garowe. Female-headed HHs and young adolescents girls will constitute approximately 60% of beneficiary households. This weighting towards female-headed households is because they are considered more vulnerable due to their restricted options for paid labor. Once a household has been identified as a beneficiary, the project will primarily target women and who have lost livelihoods as result of water shortages within the households to receive  cash for work vouchers by rehabilitating harvesting structures and Berked  as result of the water shortage, Women have been targeted as beneficiaries since they typically make household food purchases and determine meal distribution within the household. Furthermore, The proposed project will target those households in the most critical situations. Not all households are at the same level of destitution or crisis. There are, for example, some households that do not have productive assets but receive remittances from relatives abroad. Beneficiary identification and selection will be managed by KAALO and facilitated by the existing  villages and elder Committees (CRCs), which are comprised of IDPs leaders, community elders and key stakeholders\nCriteria for targeting is as follows: priority will be given to recently displaced (within the past year) female headed HHs, HHs with vulnerable members including pregnant women, children lt5, elderly, sick and/or disabled persons. Individual households (both IDP and local community) will be targeted and selected based on established criteria for vulnerability as mentioned above. \n\n1.\tRehabilitation of two water catchment to immediately access to cash for work to 300 HHs for 2 months , These will be constructed during selected months to enable over 1800 beneficiaries (300HHs) including men, women, boys and girls (gt18 years of age) get Cash for work to cover food. KAALO will distribute 100 sets of hand tools per village for two locations. Each set is composed (4 shovels,3 hoes, 12 empty bags, 3 pickaxes, and 6 wheelbarrows).These activities are targeted equally for men and women and include rehabilitation of water catchments.\n2.Provision of fodder inputs to 300 Vulnerable farmers (benefitting 1800 vulnerable persons) through which each HHS will get 7 kg of of fodder seeds to enable access to food. In line with FSC guidance, each household will receive 7kgs which includes: Soudan Grass (7kg). \n3. Construction of fodder storage canters that be used by the Agro-pastoralists to enhance production through cash for work to enable them provide storage for the fodder. activities will be implemented will have a participation of at least 50% women including at project committee level through cash for work to enable them provide storage for the fodder. \n4.Rehabilitation of 1 berkeds under Garowe district through community engagement and cash for work to improve access too food to drought affected communities. \nIn order to keep the sustainability of the project target outputs and increase the production of the beneficiaries,  KAALO will train selected farmers from the target farmers on the best technologies  and methodologies to increase their livelihood.",

The project will undertake Conditional Cash Transfer for 662 unskilled labourers and 44 semi-skilled labourers rehabilitating 9 Water Pans in 9 settlements in Galkayo South. Each of the 662 unskilled labourers shall get $6 per day while each of the 44 semi-skilled labourers will work at the rate of $8 per day:- Daily work output per person per day as per the Somalia CWG standards is 1.585M3 ( 5hours* 0.317M3). The total number of working days is 25 for each water pan, However, they will be rehabilitated in different months to allow for prudent supervision, monitoring and evaluation and reporting by the project team. The nine water pans to be rehabilitated are 1. Gaarcad, 2. Dhagfaruuryaale, 3. Cinjirre, 4. Laamawayne, 5. Rasan, 6. Balicadde, 7. Xaarxaar, 8. Qooraseyn, 9.Biyogaduud.\n\nThe project will specifically prioritise destitute pastoralists and IDP households, women from the destitute households left behind in identified accessible settlements (hard to reach areas especially such as rural areas of the four Districts). The planned project activities will help mitigate the effects of the poor October to December 2020 Deyr rains and Desert locust infestation leading to inadequate pasture, water resources and below-average crop production in Central Somalia Region. \n\nThe project will provide for continuous community engagement during the implementation process to ensure feedback from the beneficiary community necessary for determining the effectiveness of the response and emerging gaps that will require a humanitarian response. This is particularly necessary given the prediction of a possible below-average rainfall for the coming Gu 2021 season as indicated by FEWSNET/FSNAU in its February to September 2021 update. \n\nThe project will also mainstream gender and protection components in order to ensure it supports inclusiveness of both genders but in particular make women a priority in the design as direct beneficiaries, ensuring the resultant benefits of the project accrue to them. The project will also ensure there is adequate protection of women in all the venues and staging points of the project activities to ensure it provides women the safety and protection required. Covid-19 preventive measures and health guidelines will also be mainstreamed in the project implementation. \n\nCPD plans to use the first 2 months of the project to undertake household vulnerability assessment in the identified locations within South Mudug, undertake community engagement, beneficiary selection, verification and registration for the Conditional Cash Transfers beneficiaries captured in KoboConnect. The beneficiary selection will be done through a Community-Based Target process (CBT) as recommended by the Somalia Cash Working Group (CWG). The rehabilitation works involving excavation of water pans to required provided dimensions will be done across 3 months for the 9 sites in Galkayo South of Mudug region. Payments to the unskilled and semi-skilled labourers will be made through Mobile Money Transfer once the scheduled work is completed. The project will carry out post-distribution monitoring in the final month of the project.",

        "description": "Mercy-USA\u2019s strategic interventions will ensure increased access to nutrition services and expanded coverage through 4 fixed facilities, 5 outreach sites (1 mobile team), and community levels. This three-pronged approach is part of Mercy-USA\u2019s strategy to respond to populations' immediate and medium-term needs under distress by supporting the local health facilities and the Ministry of Health capacity to implement nutrition interventions in line with nutrition guidelines available. Specifically, this nutrition program will promote access to quality care, adequate nutrition, and encourage healthier behaviors to optimize the communities\u2019 resilience to future nutrition emergencies. \nMercy-USA for Aid and Development, in partnership with the MoH, will continue to address the nutrition challenges by implementing the integrated package in 2 fixed facilities in Karan district and 2 fixed facilities and 5 outreach sites (1 mobile team) in Yaqshid district in Banadir region.\nFacility and community-based Basic Nutrition Services Package (BNSP) will cover both curative and preventative interventions targeting children under 5 years old (boys and girls) and pregnant and lactating women.\nMercy-USA will ensure that the nutrition sites will receive uninterrupted therapeutic/supplementary food supplies. Mercy-USA will provide staff, technical capacity building for staff, and additional monitoring to ensure compliance with nutrition protocols. \nMercy-USA will train all nutrition staff on SAM and MAM diagnosis and management. Mercy-USA will provide regular joint supervision of the health facilities with MoH and offer refresher trainings to staff.\nThis program will promote optimal nutrition and IYCF practices that are beneficial to child survival and development by focusing on the promotion, support, and protection of EBF for children and appropriate complementary feeding to build resilience and the nutrition status of infants lt6 months (through EBF) and children 6-24 months. Mothers with children lt6 months will receive messages specific to Exclusive Breastfeeding while mothers with children 6-24 months will receive messages on breastfeeding and complementary feeding. \nScreening for malnutrition among children lt5 and PLW will be conducted primarily at the community level though this screening will also occur at the health facilities by nutrition staff. Malnourished women and children will be admitted in the relevant OTP or TSFP programs. \nAccording to IMAM guidelines, children in the nutrition program will receive relevant micronutrient supplementation such as iron/folate and Vitamin A. Women in prenatal care will receive treatment for anemia if required as well as micronutrient supplementation, and postnatal women will be supplemented with Vitamin A and treatment of anemia if required. Additionally, all children admitted in the nutrition program will receive deworming drugs and relevant89` micronutrient supplementation such as iron/folate and Vitamin A.\nSerious vaccine-preventable diseases are still prevalent in Somalia. Mercy-USA will thus support the provision of routine EPI activities. This will continue to increase immunization coverage among women and children lt5 years. IDPs, nomadic groups and remote or difficult to access communities are most at risk of missing out on routine EPI. Therefore, Mercy-USA will facilitate outreach nutrition and EPI teams to serve the people who are far from the facilities.\nAdditionally, Mercy-USA will screen everyone entering a healthcare facility for signs and symptoms of COVID-19 and ensure all the preventive and control measures. Although screening for symptoms will not identify asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic individuals with COVID 19 infection, symptom screening remains an important strategy to identify those who could have COVID-19 so appropriate precautions can be implemented.",

The proposed project aims to increase coverage and access to the management of both moderate and severe acute malnutrition (MAM/SAM), vitamin A supplementation and deworming as well as promotion of optimal infant and young child feeding (IYCF) practices. SOS will adopt an expansive IYCF in Emergencies (IYCF-E) strategy aimed at increasing reach beyond mothers raising infants but also fathers, grandfathers, community leaders, religious leaders, teachers, etc.\n\nThe proposed project will contribute to improving equitable access to quality life-saving curative and preventative nutrition services through the support of static health and nutrition facilities in Heliwa and Kaxda districts in Banadir region. The project activities will be implemented within SOS hospital in Heliwa and Community health center in Kahda The SOS nutrition teams will provide a systematic identi\ufb01cation, referral and treatment of acutely malnourished cases by providing integrated nutrition services to OTS, TSFP and Stabilization centers. The provision of OTP services for those children with SAM and the referral and treatment of SAM cases with medical complications to the SOS stabilization centre in Heliwa and other SCs in the nearest location in Kahda district. Micronutrient supplementation, promotion of IYCF practices, promoting the adoption of good hygiene and sanitation practices will be done, providing treatment for all age groups, both male and female prioritizing the disabled children to benefit from the nutrition services. The nutrition interventions will improve early identification and prevention of malnutrition and therefore reduce excess morbidity and mortality in the target districts. \n\n  Furthermore, the intervention will also provide child protection awareness creation on COVID 19 and adopt WHO and UNICEF IEC risk communication and print it in local language- Somali as well general awareness child protection prevention messages. The project will also ensure frontline health workers are well equipped and protected by distributing Personal Protective Equipments (PPEs) including facemasks, handwashing facilities, hand sanitizers, soaps, gloves, etc.\n\nFinally, SOS will carry out the proposed activities in an integrated manner with other sectors such as Health, Food Security, WASH and Child Protection to promote synergy, and to address the underlying and root causes of acute malnutrition. Effects will be made to prevent occurrence of Gender-Based Violence (GBV) by collaborating with available mechanisms in the target locations. Gender mainstreaming will be fully ensured in the community mobilization events, service provision and for the training of staff and other project stakeholders. Data for the beneficiaries will be disaggregated by age and sex. SOS will promote full participation of women, girls and boys, in the project planning, monitoring and implementation to promote their voices are heard and are taken into account including communication preferences. A particular focus will be given to ensure participation of people with special needs or with disabilities by targeting 10% of the total target population in both districts.\n\nAt the end of the project, SOS will provide the following interventions\n\tScreening of 10903 children (4361 boys, 6542 girls) and 826 PLW for acute malnutrition \n\tTreatment of 7268 children MAM and SAM \n\tTreatment of 1000 SAM with complication \n\tIYCF counselling and promotion messages\n\tMNS \n\tCapacity building of staff, MOH/BRA and CNWs",

        "description": "Despite marginal improvements from \u2018critical\u2019 levels in the overall nutrition situation in Somalia, malnutrition rates among children remained precarious at \u2018serious levels. Of concern were populations with critical prevalence of acute malnutrition above the threshold of 15 per cent, mainly in Northern Inland Pastoral Livelihood Zone (Lasanod District), as well as internally displaced persons (IDPs) due to food insecurity, high morbidity, low immunization and Vitamin-A supplementation, and poor care practices. ANPPCANSOM emergency response plan will scale up treatment of malnutrition and reach an estimated caseload of 1,407 SAM representing 50% of the nutrition cluster SAM burden of 2,806 in Lasanod District. \nThe project will provide facility-based and community based (BNSP) covering both curative and preventative interventions targeting children U5 years (boys and girls) and pregnant and lactating women. It will support the identification, referral and treatment of children suffering from moderate and severe acute malnutrition while SAM cases with medical complications will be referred to the Lasanod Stabilization Center run by MSF using standard referral forms. ANPPCANSOM will support and manage 3 health centers (Tuulo Samakaab, Halhaliye, Dan )and 2 mobile teams  covering 20 remote sites (Biriqodey, Bixin, Burowadal, Buulal, Fardhidin, Gacandar, Garac Lagu Dhal, God Qaboobe, Higlo Fiqi, Faleeryale  Canjiid, Laas Magugle, Jidbaale, Kalax, Sango Jabiye, Karin Dabayl, Saha Gebogebo, Buq-Xaar, Adhicadeeye, Akuule) within Lasanod district. \nIn order to ensure the sustainability of nutrition interventions, local technical capacity will be strengthened by integrating SAM management into the Primary Health Care system through the functional MCHs. Additionally, the capacity of nutrition staff will be strengthened for effective service delivery at facility and community level. \nANPPCANSOM will maintain treatment outcomes consistent with Sphere standards using the combined protocol for the management of acute malnutrition in close consultation and coordination with Somalia Nutrition Cluster, Somaliland Nutrition Working Group and other nutrition partners including MOHD, UNICEF and WFP. ANPPCANSOM will build on and sustain the delivery of a holistic basic nutrition services package (BNSP) in priority to the target communities including internally displaced people and their host communities and other socially marginalized groups in pastoral and hard to reach in Lasanod district areas while ensuring the inclusion of treatment, promotion and prevention components in this project. \nThe project will support community mobilization and screening as well as micro-nutrient supplementation for PLW (multiple micro-nutrients and Iron folate) and Vitamin A supplementation for children between 6-59 months. It will also provide de-worming for children 12-59 months and pregnant women in the 2nd and 3rd trimester as well as counselling and promotion on infant and young child feeding compounded with health and hygiene promotion. Moreover, measles immunization will be provided to infants living within the catchment areas of the target health centers who are not immunized against measles. Systematic defaulter tracing for immunization services will also be conducted at community level. \n\nIn order to strengthen the accountability with affected population, we will introduce mother-led MUAC approach to increase detection, identification and early referral of malnourished children. ANPPCANSOM will train mothers to use MUAC tapes to enable mothers screen, detect oedema and self-referral of their children to nutrition sites.\nLikewise, the project will give particular emphasis on the current COVID-19 pandemic prevention measure to contain the spread of the virus. Gender and protection activities will be effectively mainstreamed into the project. Every effort will be made to ensure equity and to reach the most vulnerable population in Lasanod District.",

        "description": "FSNAU 2020 post Deyr assessment indicates both GAM and SAM are serious with aggravating factors.  Food security is expected to worsen. The poor October to December 2020 Deyr rains led to the inadequate pasture, water resources and below average crop production. Weather predictions point towards a second consecutive season of below-average rainfall from April to June due to the La Nina effect. \nThe key issues for children and women remain access to prevention and treatment interventions in the absence of a fully functional and stable health system. Tied to that is scarce availability of health professionals and poor community literacy levels (UNICEF 2019 OCHA 2020). Malnutrition is one of the key issues affecting children 6-59 moths and significantly contributing to mortality, considering relationship between malnutrition and disease. \nServices in Dhobley barely reach rural areas because of poor infrastructure . Therefore poor performing indicators like: Poor IYCF, low latrine coverage,low immunization coverage, severe food shortages and poor coverage of nutrition service/health facility are reported (WHO,2020SARA ,2016 FSNAU,2021).  Water shortage has already been reported in Dhobley with population displaced due to water shortage. This is expected to get worse if the predicted La Nina manifests next month (OCHA, 2021)\nWomen and children urgently need integrated services targeting prevention and treatment of both moderate and severe acute malnutrition.  WRRS is currently implementing a nutrition project by WFP that focuses on treatment of moderate acute malnutrition ( MAM) and maternal, child health and nutriton (MCHN) at health facilities . These services have not integrated treatment of  severe acute malnutrition (SAM) therefore children with SAM  are left untreated and so at risk of death. WFP funded project also lacks key primary prevention interventions like Micro nutrient supplementation for children 6-59 months and PLW, de worming and IYCF support. Integrating these services will  contribute to significant reduction in prevalence of malnutrition and related mortality.\nThe project will apply the grant strategy and help achieve cluster objective 2 of providing life saving interventions especially for those affected by drought like conditions. It focuses on scaling up and fully integrating nutrition interventions that will ensure full treatment of acute malnutrition.The proposed project will link to SHF's 2021 allocation strategy, the fund's strategic objectives and cluster specific objectives. We hope this will bring down the effects of the prevailing triple threat of COVID 19, floods and Desert Locusts , in addition to the most recent predicted La Nina, on acute malnutrition state. \nWRRS is currently implementing a nutrition project funded by WFP that covers treatment of Moderate acute malnutrition, MCHN and a relief project. The proposed project will bring in treatment of both complicated and uncomplicated severe acute malnutrition thus ensuring full treatment of acute malnutrition at one stop. Beneficiaries will not be referred to other facilities and/or partners, which sometimes complicates treatment by increasing defaulters. This project will also support primary prevention interventions not covered by WFP project, which are very vital. These will include Infant and young child feeding (IYCF) support and micro nutrient supplication for both children under five and pregnant and lactating women (PLW). This proposed project seeks to scale up and integrate treatment of acute malnutrition through a fixed site in Dhobley,being in a health facility. which will of will offer TSFP for treatment of MAM,OTP for treatment of  uncomplicated SAM and Stabilization center for treatment of complicated SAM, all these with prevention interventions. There will also be 1 mobile team to cover IDP  and hard to reach rural areas with treatment of MAM and uncomplicated SAM integrating  prevention interventions.",

In Ceelwaq nutrition situation of district continues to deteriorate further with limited humanitarian assistance. Post day 2020 released by FSNAU in Februar 2021 indicated that a chronic high level of acute malnutrition in Elwak district. The target areas have many challenges contributing to acute malnutrition particularly rural areas where access is constrained. The Desert Locust has caused significant damage to 2020 pastures and grassing land for livestock\u2019s which the backbone liveliho of communities in Ceelwaq. The latest forecasts indicate that Desert Locust continues to pose a very high risk to rural livelihoods across Somalia in 2021, potentially exacerbating the impact of the anticipated below-average 2021 Gu rains. The Nutrition Cluster estimates caseloads of about 300 SAM and 2120 MAM annually in the Ceelwaq district with an estimated population of about 30,689 population PESS. HDC is an active nutrition/health partner and currently implementing EAC simplified protocol in partnership with UNICEF as well HIV-Global fund emergency health in Ceelwaq general hospital, Dhamasa and Hosqurun MCHs in Ceelwaq district. In Decembe 2020, UNICEF emergency projects, Covid 19, emergency primary health and implementation of the expanded admission criteria of acute malnutrition to the outpatient therapeutic program EAC that supported health and nutrition intervention in Ceelwaq district implemented by HDC came to a end. This left a gap in health and nutrition in three-way district. The Proposed project will therefore bridge the major essential nutrition service gap that currently exists in Ceelwaq following the ended UNICEF and HDC PD out of the integrated health and nutrition Project. The project will address the identified gaps in nutrition, enhancing access to nutrition services within their localities aimed at improving the physical and mental well-being of boys, girls, men and women in the targeted locations. These specific needs have been outlined in the HRP and FSNAU and UNOCHA mulita cluster need rapid assessment gaps identified in the targeted locations. The proposed project is geared towards reducing the vulnerability of the beneficiaries and communities. HDC will work with MOH-Federal, JSS-MOH to address the nutrition gaps identified. The services will be both preventive and curative targeting vulnerable men, women, boys, girls, and persons living with physical disabilities in the targeted district. 2 Mobile and outreach implementation models will be adopted to address the needs of vulnerable beneficiaries in remote and geographically isolated and hard to reach populations in Ceelwaq district. Screening for malnutrition will be carried out and children with MAM will be treated in OTP sites. Children with MAM will be referred to HDC Managed district hospital supported by UNICEF before but still functional supporting by HDC. Children diagnosed with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) with medical complication will be referred to the SCs that HDC propose to support in Ceelwaq district hospital and Damase referral health center in Ceelwaq district. However, we are facing a shortage of funding to sustain the existing nutrition services. Through this project, HDC is planning to maintain and support the existing nutrition services (2 fixed OTP, 1 stabilization center in the Ceelwaq general hospital with integration of health projects and one mobile teams into reaching 6 villages comprising IDPs and Hard to reach rural population mostly affected by crises in Elwak district. This nutrition intervention will build on HDC's ongoing emergency nutrition and health interventions in high risks areas in Ceelwaq district and will support the continuation of essential life-saving treatment in the context of COVID and other ongoing outbreaks in line with IMAM guideline.",

This will also entail identifying pressing capacity gaps and supporting state institutions and administrative structures to systematically address HLP violations and contribute to social cohesion in target communities.\n\nThe proposed action builds on NRC\u2019s hands-on expertise in HLP programming in Somalia, and targeting 4030 households in Kismayo, the project seeks to enhance the protection of displaced affected communities HLP rights and to create an enabling environment for sustained recovery and the pursuit of long-lasting solutions. This overarching objective will be achieved by implementing a combination of complementary activities to reduce the practice of unlawful evictions, strengthen tenure security among displaced communities at the highest risk of eviction, and consolidate the protection of HLP rights. Priority actions include the following:\n-\tprovision of reliable and up-to-date information and specialised services necessary to navigate administrative and procedural obstacles linked to the enjoyment and exercise of HLP rights \n-\texpanding access to tenure security through documentation and technical support monitoring and mapping of evictions trends \n-\tsupporting the Kismayo Evictions Taskforce to lead in evictions response and programming and helping victims cope with post-eviction stress through cash \n-\tstrengthening local dispute resolution capacities and fostering social cohesion in target communities\n-\tprovision of legal counselling, assistance and representation \n-\tcapacity-building trainings for rights holders, decision-makers and duty bearers on HLP and\n-\tadvocacy and undertaking comprehensive assessments and surveys, leading to the development of action plans and informing planned relocations.\n\nThe centrality of Housing, Land and Property (HLP) assistance is a key component to achieving lasting durable solutions for Displacement Affected Communities (DACs). Sustainable (re)integration remains unattainable without securing access to land, improving security of tenure and reducing the threat of evictions. Against this backdrop, there are multiple challenges linked to accessing HLP rights by DACs that exist. The HLP challenges are created by repeated, protracted displacement in urban areas exacerbated by the high demand (in the context of rapid urbanisation, investment and development) and skyrocketing land prices. This has been compounded by competing claims on land coupled with limited legal and policy frameworks around HLP rights, inadequate technical and functional capacities of state institutions, and weak mechanisms for resolving HLP disputes. Besides, DACs lack knowledge of their HLP rights and how to exercise them, and women\u2019s access to HLP rights is adversely affected due to discriminatory customs.",

        "description": "Since the beginning of 2020, additional shocks, extensive floods, desert locust infestations, the COVID-19 pandemic and drought have had compounding effects, further deteriorating already compromised systems and gains that had already been made in the economy. The secondary impacts have impacted directly the well-being of children with the rise of negative coping mechanisms being witnessed and reported such as rise in child marriage, psychological distress, sexual violence and other harmful practices. According to the Humanitarian Needs Overview (2021) children and adolescents in Somalia are targets of killing, maiming and abduction, recruitment into armed groups, detention, sexual and physical violence. Boys are at an elevated risk of recruitment to armed groups. The actual extent of grave violations of children\u2019s rights is higher than what is reported and verified. Separated and unaccompanied children are at heightened risk of various forms of violence, exploitation and abuse. While some have been placed into alternative care arrangements, a large number live alone or in the street. COVID-19 and the drought situation has stretched the foster families providing alternative care to the children. The Child Protection AoR assessment in 2020 carried out among partners also reported that children were expressing aggressive behaviors which point out to psychological distress stemming from the dire living conditions at home. IA recent study conducted by WVI in Luuq and other neighboring districts revealed that the market places, water points were some of the places identified by both IDPs and host communities as unsafe for children. The major child protection concerns identified during this study included child labour, child marriage, school dropout and sexual violence. These results are   corroborated by the education cluster reports that indicated that children are out of school in Gedo region as a result of drought with about 6000 primary school children affected. This project has been designed to respond to these needs through risk mitigation and prevention of violations of children rights and addressing child protection needs through case management. Leveraging on already existing health, WASH and Food and Cash Assistance projects in Luuq, this project\u2019s interventions have been designed to synergize efforts to deliver well-coordinated interventions to address the child protection needs. This presence of WVI staff in Luuq and the existing connection with community structures already provides registered vulnerable people groups for this project to build on. Prevention of violations and risk mitigation through a community led process has been factored including capacity building plans for self-protection among the children and their care givers. Awareness raising on the child protection and equipping of care givers with positive parenting skills is provided for to ensure children associated with armed forces and armed groups are safely re-integrated within their households and community.  To increase access to specialized child protection services either directly or through referral, update and dissemination of the referral pathway is one of the key intervention planned for to raise awareness among service providers and the community for quick and timely response. Provision for MHPSS at individual and group level has been created to meet the needs of children across different ages. Home visits will be facilitated by the care givers to meet the needs of children with disability to ensure they are not left out. Child Friendly Spaces as a measure for MHPSS has also been included in the project. COVID-19 control measures of hand washing and provision of masks for the children will be done. Screening before admission will also be done with the CFS being equipped with thermometers. Through these activities, 1300boys, 1650girls, 850men, 1100 women and 354 of persons with disability 50M,60W,122B and122G will be reached.",

        "description": "The impact of the ongoing drought compounded by economic and social impacts of COVID-19 escalated conflict and forecast of below-average Deyr rainfall from April to June 2021 may result in further deterioration of humanitarian outcomes for affected communities. Thus, in this project, AADSOM will improve access to safe water, sanitation facilities and promote good hygiene practices to reduce the negative impacts of the flood followed by drought in the Jalalaqsi district to 15,000 women, men, boys, and girls including people with disabilities, minorities and most vulnerable underserved and/or hard to reach communities from 5 villages under Jalalaqsi namely Doondheere, Raafey, Habar robe, Cadiley, Sheeloow, Dirggoys east, Buulo Barwaaqo, Baqdaad east and Jalalaqsi town. Key activities AADSOM would like to undertake within this project are the following WASH services:\nWater:\n- Provision of safe water to 1,000 households representing 6,000 men, women and children affected population through water vendors (water trucking) by using Water Voucher (WV) for a period of 45 days. (Site of the distribution selection by the women/girls should aim at reducing the risk of violence against women and children accessing water sources through their participation in discussions).\n\n- Construction of 5 flood-proof shallow wells with hand pumps in 5 villages in Jalalaqsi district, (Baqdad east, Dirgoys east, Raafey, Dondheere, and Bulo Barwaaqo) with special consideration on disabled and child-friendly accessibility.\n- Upgrade one borehole in Jalalaqsi town (Amaana Borehole) Howlwadaag section of Jalalaqsi town, equipped with the hybrid system including rehabilitation of existing water tank, construction of water kiosk for human use, Construction of engine room, and piping network.\n- Establishment and capacity building training to gender-balanced 6 WASH committees and 12 Well Operators shared equally by men and women, to ensure continuity of service, operation, and maintenance, coupled training on DDR and conflict resolution mechanisms as cross-cutting.\n\nHygiene and Sanitation:\nLack of access to adequate and appropriate sanitation and hygiene poses a serious threat to public health. The practice of open defecation is a leading cause of fecal-oral transmission of diseases with children being the most vulnerable. A safe and appropriate latrine accompanied by handwashing with soap provides an effective barrier to the transmission of diseases. The provision of appropriate facilities for defecation is also an essential response for people\u2019s dignity, safety, health, and well-being. To improve safe access to sanitation it is necessary to meet standards of privacy and safety of women and girls against GBV using sanitation structures that are locally or culturally acceptable. nevertheless, the disabilities will be given a special design that is appropriate and acceptable for use. in this project, AADSOM will: \n\n- Conduct comprehensive hygiene promotion compounded with covid-19 awareness campaigns to reach 15,000 men, women, boys, and girls through visiting house to house, schools, health, and feeding centers. \n-Train 10 community hygiene promoters (5 men and 5 women), who will carry out hygiene promotion activities during and after the project is faced out. \n-Distribute 500 HP kits to 500 households with vulnerable men, women, and children, and\n- Construct 58 gender-sensitive and flood-proof latrines aimed at ensuring the sustainability of the latrines during floods to the most affected community including 5 latrines especially constructed for disabled people.\nTo  strengthen the local markets-Based Programming (MBP) approach AADSOM will ensure that:\n- The service providers should be selected locally if available.\n- The contracted service providers should purchase the required material and equipment in the local market if available.\n- The contracted service provider should hire skilled and skilled workers from the local people.",

        "description": "Somalia\u2019s prolonged humanitarian crisis is characterized by ongoing conflicts, climate-related shocks, communicable disease outbreaks, and weak social protection mechanisms. Since the beginning of 2020, three additional shocks have contributed to a deterioration of humanitarian conditions: Extensive floods, Desert Locust infestations, and the COVID-19 pandemic. These compounding shocks have exacerbated humanitarian needs among a population already living under the strain of widespread poverty and decades of armed conflict and insecurity. Climate change continues to be a major contributing factor to displacement and food insecurity in Somalia.\nIncreasingly erratic weather patterns and climatic shocks have led to prolonged and severe drought conditions and floods, with devastating humanitarian consequences. Flooding displaced 919,000 people in 2020 and destroyed essential infrastructure, property, and 144,000 hectares of agricultural land. a serious lack of access to clean water and sanitation is heightening the risk of outbreaks of water-borne diseases exacerbating existing fragilities, especially where health services are too few and/or too distant. In this project, ARD is aimed to improve access to WASH services for Ceelberde IDPs, host communities with recognition of people of disabilities, and the most vulnerable population through the provision of safe water drinking with water vouchers for 60 days period,. Construction/rehabilitation of 22 flood-proof shallow wells with hand pumps, benefiting around 11,000 (2500 men, 5700 women, 1400 girls, and 1400 boys) crisis-affected IDPs and host communities will be under taken. ARD will also construct 50 flood-resistant latrines to benefit residents in the Ceelberde IDP sites which will also receive the clean water and hygiene promotions and hygiene kits. Approximately, 10% of the 50 latrines (corresponding to 5) will be preserved for people with disabilities living in the target locations. A total of 2500 (500 men, 1500 women, 250 girls, and 250 boys) people will benefit from access to the sanitation, 1000 Households will benefit from hygiene kit distribution and hygiene awareness, Chlorination of wells and WASH committees will be established in addition, carry out environmental sanitation services to all project target locations especially IDP camps to improve all preventive measures against the risks of AWD/cholera outbreaks in Ceelberde district,",

These interventions are based on the 2021 allocation strategy paper, 2021 Jubaland Drought Risk Assessment findings, and the proposed activities are well aligned with the Health and WASH cluster priorities.\nThe project aims to improve access for health services to mitigate, control and manage outbreaks (waterborne diseases) and filling critical gaps, while also addressing safe water and sanitation provision through emergency/ lifesaving WASH interventions and enhancing better hygiene practices in Kismayo district. This project will reach 22,000  beneficiaries (men: 5,060, women: 5,500, boys:5,500 , girls: 5,940) over nine (9) months.\nThe health component will seek to support two (2) mobile health teams to ensure provision of emergency and essential primary health care services with emphasis on waterborne disease mitigation, control and management. SC will support the mobile health teams to provide emergency reproductive health services for underserved with referral pathways established for Gender Based violence (GBV) and Mental Health and Psychosocial Support (MHPSS) linkages. Provision of essential medication and supplies (including Personal Protective equipment (PPEs) and COVID-19 related supplies) will be ensured for the mobile teams with well-integrated patient safety protocols as well as accessibility and accountability mechanisms. SC will also support provision of essential routine immunization services. To ensure preventative measures for diseases and outbreaks, SC will actively support community engagement and health education (with integrated hygiene messages) to community members of different sex, age and disability groups in a dignified manner.\nFor the WASH component, SC plans to conduct water trucking through vouchers to 8,889 drought affected settlements, rehabilitate 5 shallow wells, and 1 extension of existing water infrastructure. The project will also increase access to communal latrines and hand-washing with soap through construction of 56 culture sensitive latrines while addressing specific needs of different sex and disability groups to ensure safety and easy access to facilities. Additionally, beneficiaries of the water and sanitation and health services will be sensitized on hygiene promotion measures with a focus on proper hand washing with soap, safe waste and excreta disposal and household (HH) water treatment and safe storage, distribute 3666 hygiene kits including female specific hygiene items (sanitary clothes, etc.) to vulnerable households and build community resilience and increase sustainability of WASH services by enhancing the capacity of village level WASH management committees to manage, operate and maintain WASH facilities.\nThe project is designed to ensure equitable access to WASH services by older people and those with disabilities, safety of children and dignity and privacy for women and girls. Coordination with health and WASH clusters at national and state levels will be maintained, in addition to ongoing coordination with general key actors in Lower Juba. The project will address gender issues through collecting sex and age disaggregated data which will be analyzed to identify gaps, provide gender sensitive interventions and ensure participation and empowerment of women. Protection of beneficiaries will be ensured during access and utilization of services seeking to reduce further risks.\nSC aims to increase access to clean and safe drinking water, sanitation and improve hygiene knowledge and promote the adoption of safe hygiene practices among the communities, contributing to a reduced risk of disease outbreak and acute needs.",

        "description": "This Joint FGS-UN Programme aims to capitalise on recent security, governance and reconciliation achievements by expanding employment opportunities for young men and women, mainly in newly recovered areas. The programme recognizes the centrality of youth in fostering stability in the country and outlines specific interventions that can be taken within the next 24 months to begin to generate decent work opportunities for young people that will serve as positive alternatives to participation in violence and conflict. This will also contribute to the revitalization of the local economy. The programme will tackle youth at risk, unemployed and underemployed youth. The employment generating interventions from this programme also aim to augment the credibility of the FGS and build trust and confidence in local governance and security sector institutions while providing immediate peace dividends to vulnerable sub-sections of the population. As encouraged in the New Deal Compact, this joint youth employment programme is a frontline intervention of the FGS to achieve rapid results under Peace and State-building Goal (PSG) 4 (Economic Foundations), which identifies youth employment through job creation and skills development as one of the most important priority projects over the next two years. Creating growth and job opportunities are a crucial part of development assistance and Somalia is in urgent need of decent employment and income generation opportunities. The private sector is responsible for 90 percent of jobs in developing countries, making it an essential partner in the fight against poverty and the engine of innovation, investment and growth. There are many obstacles which stand in the way of private sector development, the mains ones being: unfavourable investment climate, infrastructure shortages, lack of access to finance, lack of skills development opportunities and weak linkages between supply and distribution chains. Tackling such constraints will create job opportunities for young Somali men and women. Therefore, the FGS, with the support of UN agencies, will undertake the following interventions in newly recovered areas and other government priority areas over the next 24 months. The programme will initially be tailored for the first 24 months as per the Compact deadline (see also Table 1): \u2022 1: Improved long-term potential for growth, productivity and employment of at least three value chains in the agriculture, fisheries and livestock sector. \u2022 2: Equip 10,000 youth with basic literacy, numeracy and life-skills and sector-specific vocational and business training to enhance their employability to access sustainable job opportunities in sectors with high growth and employment potential. \u2022 3: Create 30,000 short-term jobs created through cash-for-work projects to rehabilitate productive infrastructure in target locations, mainly in newly recovered areas.",

It builds on ongoing work to promote employment, decent work and income opportunities in Somalia. The project strategy draws on the findings of the review of the DWCP of Somalia (2014-2016), which among other issues, has pointed to the need for tailored capacity development interventions to enable workers and employers organizations to deliver services to their members and effectively engage in social dialogue. The project interventions will focus on: (i) addressing the youth employment challenges; (ii) creating a strong connection between humanitarian and development support; (iii) building on employment-intensive investment strategies; and (iv) integrating direct employment creation and skills and enterprise development for increased employability. The project is expected to provide opportunities for the ILO to leverage resources, expertise and synergies at the country level, notably through cooperation and collaboration within the UN system as well as with development partners. This project contributes to the country\u2019s efforts to advance towards the attainment of SDG targets 1.5 (Build the resilience of the poor and those in vulnerable situations and reduce their exposure and vulnerability to climate-related extreme events and other economic, social and environmental shocks and disasters) and 8.3 (Promote development-oriented policies that support productive activities, decent job creation, entrepreneurship, creativity and innovation, and encourage the formalization and growth of micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises, including through access to financial services).",

        "description": "A locust invasion in Somalia is threatening livelihoods as crops and vegetation for livestock foraging suffer extensive damage. According to the Somaliland National Disaster Preparedness and Food Reserve Authority (NADFOR) localized damage has been observed in Somaliland, where locusts have occupied a total of 100,000ha of Somaliland\u2019s coastal region including Woqooyi Galbeed. This has affected1,087,264 people, of which 22,853 are in IDPs camps. SC has observed the impact of the locust invasion to be most severe in Hargeisa Maroodijeh with 8,000ha of rangeland and 3,000ha of crop land damaged. In addition, Agabar and Arbasiyo villages in Gabiley districts have also been hard-hit with 1,000ha of damaged land. The Woqooyi Galbeed region was already characterized by significant food security gaps which is exacerbated by the desert locust crisis. According to the FSNAU technical release 153,000 people are food insecure (IPC 3 or 4) including 12,054 in Gabiley district and 139,134 in Hargeisa district. An SC survey showed that pastoralists are skipping meals or selling their remaining livestock for low prices to purchase food. There is also an increasing trend of labor migration at the critical time of Gu seasonal preparation. Only few actors respond to the locust crisis in this area including SOS and World Vision. Response gaps affirmed by the Food Security Cluster (FSC) monthly dashboard show 150,000 people need urgent Multi-Purpose Cash (MPC) support to protect access to food security. These include IDPs and pastoralists who have lost their livestock and have less than 6 goats. In addition to the locust crisis, Somalia is also at risk of an outbreak of the COVID-19 virus. Somalia reported its first confirmed case of COVID-19 on 16th March 2020 and currently has 60 recorded cases including 5 in Somaliland and 2 in Woqooyi Galbeed. Given the rapid pace of the virus and lack of access to testing kits, there are concerns that the number of cases will rise rapidly.",

During this two-year project the network will collaboratively develop and implement a \u201cTraining of Trainers\u201d (ToT) model, as a strategy to develop institutional and research capacity in EBPH. First social network theory and analysis (SNTA) will be used to assess a Swedish/Somali ToT-course conducted in 2016-2018 by the Somali-Swedish Research Cooperation for Health (SSRCH). The knowledge from this will inform the design of the second ToT course with faculty staff (gender equity) from all involved Somali universities (2021-2022). A concrete outcome will be the establishment of three new research groups that have refined research project plans. Later likely more groups will be formed.Ultimately this will contribute to improved health of the Somali population and achievement of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG\u2019s), especially SDG 3 \u2013 Good health and wellbeing, SDG 4 - Quality education, and SDG 16 \u2013 Peace, justice and strong institutions.",

About 26% of Somalia\u00b4s population live a nomadic life, and this significant group of about 4 million people is believed to have even less access to modern health care and health promotion than the rest of the population.This project aims to build up a network of knowledgeable researchers in Somalia, Kenya and Sweden to, together with representatives of the nomadic population and the Ministry of Health, build up a knowledge bank on nomadic health and health care access. The project will also develop a research application for deeper analysis of 1) central health problems to the nomad population, 2) obstacles to access health care, and 3) design and test interventions to create better access to both emergency care and elective care under the special living conditions of the nomadic population.The University of Gothenburg, KEMRI (Wellcome Trust funded health research program in Kenya) and Benadir University in Somalia are initiating this work but intend to join more partners over the next two years. During the project, three major workshops will be conducted in the relatively safe Hargeisa, Somaliland, and the database will be built by Benadir University.",

As highlighted in the Economic Recovery Plan, issues around job creation, economic growth and private sector development will lie at the heart of Somali recovery and reconstruction.\n\nAccordingly, the overall objective of the programme is to contribute to the long-term reconstruction of the conflict ridden society in Somalia through increased human security and improved livelihoods, while the specific objective of the intervention is employment creation and improved incomes for those economically active specifically for women and youth across the country. The programme is intended to be catalytic and engage the diaspora for the purpose of leveraging funds as well as transferring knowledge. With strong entrepreneurial propensities and cultural linkages to Somalia, the Somali diaspora in Sweden and elswhere can play an important part in developing businesses that can create jobs in Somalia. It is important to clarify that the programme does not only target the diaspora but Somali entrepreneurs in the country are also eligible for the programme.\n\nThe programme employs  a comprehensive approach that consists of four major components which are intended to complement each other:\n1. A Capacity Development Facility (CDF) for interested entrepreneurs and potential grantees. the CDF will be divided into a general capacity development in business development as well as a tailor-made capacity development for grantees.\n2. A Challenge Fund module that offers financing to entrepreneurs at an early stage of\nthe business venture in order to enable them to explore opportunities and start up a business with potential for job creating opportunities.\n3. Access to more capital support function which is intended to support grantees and interested entrepreneurs to access financing from other challenge funds or through Sida\u2019s guarantee systems for larger finances.\n4. A Scale up analysis module which is intended to collect and convey analysed market data into the New Deal/PSG4 policy level for improved policies that will contribute to enabling environment for business throughout the country.\n\nBy combining these four components the programme puts in place the necessary prerequisites for successful and sustainable business creation and hence increased productive employment. The engagement of the diaspora will not only leverage funds and businesses but will also contribute to knowledge transfer in the long term. Furthermore, the data collected from the programme through its scale up analysis module will be expected to contribute to positive changes at the policy level and hopefully have bigger positive impact at the national level.\n\nThe programme has identified opportunities in certain sectors which is believed could have potential to have wider impact on business growth and hence contribute to productive employment. These identified sectors are: Agriculture, fisheries, healthcare, ICT, renewable energy and water & sanitation. However, while projects of high quality from these sectors will be prioritized the bottom line of the programme still lies in the creation of productive employment in a sustainable manner within any given sector.",

The decision is made in accordance with Sida\u2019s contribution management rule, paragraph 3.11.3 and corresponds to the second year of a three year agreement.\n\nIn accordance with Sida\u2019s humanitarian allocation process 2018, Sida proposes to support NRC\u2019s humanitarian programs in the following 21 countries; Afghanistan, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Libya, Mali, Nigeria, Palestine, Somalia, South Sudan, Syrian Arab Republic, Uganda, Ukraine and Yemen. \nSida will contribute with an unearmarked allocation per country, which will give NRC the flexibility to meet the most acute humanitarian needs in ever-changing contexts. However, in the specific case of Palestine, Sida will earmark the contribution to the ICLA-component, as this sector is considered high priority and as contributory to the HRPs focus on protection.  \nThe support to Central African Republic and the Democratic Republic of Congo is suggested to span over a two-year period. This is in line with Sida\u2019s ambition to increase our partner\u2019s predictability, and allow for their long-term planning and alignment with a multi-year HRP.\n\nSida assesses NRC\u2019s country programs as relevant in relation to the Swedish strategy for humanitarian assistance 2017-2020, as well as the humanitarian needs identified in Sida\u2019s humanitarian crises analyses for 2018. \n\nSida is also suggesting a multi-year contribution to NRC\u2019s Rapid Response Mechanism, to allow for a timely response to sudden onset situations or escalating crises.   \n\nFurthermore, Sida suggests a two-year financial contribution to the NRC-led Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC), which strives to increase knowledge on the needs of internally displaced, and one-year contributions to the NRC/NORCAP managed project \u201cStrengthening capacity for use of cash- and market based responses in humanitarian action\u201d, to NRC's internal work on \"Digital Transformation\" and to NRC\u2019s work on humanitarian policy, which includes work to strengthen the global humanitarian system and NGO participation in the system.\n\nSida also proposes to channel funds through NRC for the support of three NGO platforms; the Jordan INGO Forum (JIF), the Lebanon Humanitarian INGO Forum (LHIF) and the International Association of Development Agencies (AIDA).  In regard to AIDA, the Consulate General in Jerusalem has the intention to provide support for AIDA within the framework of the cooperation strategy for Palestine. Efficiency gains can be achieved by providing the support through the NRC-Sida humanitarian unit cooperation agreement, and it is thus suggested that Sida/HUM channels this limited development funding, with funding delegated from Palestine Strategy, decision number XXX XXXX\n\nNRC\u2019s target group is mainly comprised of refugees and internally displaced persons but also when relevant, host communities and returnees. NRC is working within its six core competencies (sectors); shelter, livelihoods and food security, education, water and sanitation, camp management and legal advice.\n\nSida and NRC have collaborated since 2005. NRC was granted Sida Strategic Partnership in 2013. NRC is an important partner for Sida as the organisation operates in some of the world's most difficult humanitarian crises. NRC was during 2017 Sidas/Hums largest humanitarian CSO partner, and is expected to remain so in 2018.\n\nSida\u2019s support to NRC comprises a three year agreement for humanitarian activities, for which funding is decided each year based on Sida\u2019s allocation process and NRC\u2019s yearly application. Additional funding is granted through supplementary decisions throughout the year.\nApart from the flexible support offered through the Program Based Approach, NRC may reallocate up to 10 % of funds between RRM-projects in the same country and within individual project budgets. For changes above 10 %, Sida\u2019s prior written approval is needed.\n\nUPDATE 2021\nIncreasingly NRC is developing its programming on the basis of a gender analysis. It is mainstreaming gender across its 6 core competencies of the humanitarian response. The reporting is still to be improved for capturing performances and outcomes regarding the gender perspective in NRC's programmes. NRC is not yet equipped to track the age dimension of the gender perspective in its monitoring framework, but will address this gap as recommended by Sida.\n\nThis partnership agreement was extended to 31 December 2020 for the activity period. In 2020, NRC received 402.7 mkr in total for its humanitarian programmes and projects, including 330.9 mkr for crisis response in 26 settings, 50 mkr for RRMs and 21.8 mkr for capacity development.

The intervention aims at improving the health and nutrition status of the Somali people and thus contributing to reduction in maternal and child mortality by increasing the use of Reproductive Maternal Neonatal Child Health (RMNCH) and nutrition services that are accessible, available, affordable, of acceptable quality and affordable.\n\nThe intervention adopts the Health Systems Strengthening approach and will: 1) Improve governance and leadership at all levels of the health sector; 2) Ensure skilled and motivated health workforce that is distributed equally and equipped to deliver quality RMNCH and nutrition services through a continuum of care; 3) Ensure RMNCH and Nutrition services available, accessible, affordable, of acceptable quality and adaptable, within the Essential Package of Health Services (EPHS) framework; 4) Improve access, availability, quality and rational use of essential medicines, vaccines and medical equipment and physical structures; 5) Improve access, availability, acceptability, quality and use of health information that covers disease surveillance as well as management information system; and 6) Promote steady progress to an equitable and efficient health financing system.\n\nThe Somali Health Authorities (consisting of the Federal Ministry of Health for the Somali Republic as well as the Ministries of Health in Somaliland and Puntland) owns the program, UNICEF is the management agent and hence the contracting administrative agent for this joint-UN programme, where also WHO and UNFPA support the operationalization of the programme. The programme is overseen by the Somali Health Sector Committee with technical back-stopping through the Health Advisory Board. \n\nThe intervention\u2019s total budget is MSEK 1 522 for 2014-2016. Current donors that have committed support to the programme are Sida, DFID, USAID and the Swiss Development Cooperation (SDC). The current total funding commitments for 2014-2016 amount to approximately 50% of the planned budget. Implementation of the programme is planned in accordance to available funding.

The intervention aims at improving the health and nutrition status of the Somali people and thus contributing to reduction in maternal and child mortality by increasing the use of Reproductive Maternal Neonatal Child Health (RMNCH) and nutrition services that are accessible, available, affordable, of acceptable quality and affordable.\n\nThe intervention adopts the Health Systems Strengthening approach and will: 1) Improve governance and leadership at all levels of the health sector; 2) Ensure skilled and motivated health workforce that is distributed equally and equipped to deliver quality RMNCH and nutrition services through a continuum of care; 3) Ensure RMNCH and Nutrition services available, accessible, affordable, of acceptable quality and adaptable, within the Essential Package of Health Services (EPHS) framework; 4) Improve access, availability, quality and rational use of essential medicines, vaccines and medical equipment and physical structures; 5) Improve access, availability, acceptability, quality and use of health information that covers disease surveillance as well as management information system; and 6) Promote steady progress to an equitable and efficient health financing system.\n\nThe Somali Health Authorities (consisting of the Federal Ministry of Health for the Somali Republic as well as the Ministries of Health in Somaliland and Puntland) owns the program, UNICEF is the management agent and hence the contracting administrative agent for this joint-UN programme, where also WHO and UNFPA support the operationalization of the programme. The programme is overseen by the Somali Health Sector Committee with technical back-stopping through the Health Advisory Board. \n\nThe intervention\u2019s total budget is MSEK 1 522 for 2014-2016. Current donors that have committed support to the programme are Sida, DFID, USAID and the Swiss Development Cooperation (SDC). The current total funding commitments for 2014-2016 amount to approximately 50% of the planned budget. Implementation of the programme is planned in accordance to available funding. A health finance strategy is about to be finalized that will be used to mobilize remaining needed resources to take the programme to its full potential.",

        "description": "Reprogrammed funds to address COVID-19\nReprogrammed funds to mitigate the impact of COVID-19\nUPDATED 2018\nThis is a supplementary decision to the agreement with the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) for their humanitarian program 2017-2019. The decision is made in accordance with Sida\u2019s contribution management rule, paragraph 3.11.3 and corresponds to the second year of a three year agreement.\n\nIn accordance with Sida\u2019s humanitarian allocation process 2018, Sida proposes to support NRC\u2019s humanitarian programs in the following 21 countries; Afghanistan, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Libya, Mali, Nigeria, Palestine, Somalia, South Sudan, Syrian Arab Republic, Uganda, Ukraine and Yemen. \nSida will contribute with an unearmarked allocation per country, which will give NRC the flexibility to meet the most acute humanitarian needs in ever-changing contexts. However, in the specific case of Palestine, Sida will earmark the contribution to the ICLA-component, as this sector is considered high priority and as contributory to the HRPs focus on protection.  \nThe support to Central African Republic and the Democratic Republic of Congo is suggested to span over a two-year period. This is in line with Sida\u2019s ambition to increase our partner\u2019s predictability, and allow for their long-term planning and alignment with a multi-year HRP.\n\nSida assesses NRC\u2019s country programs as relevant in relation to the Swedish strategy for humanitarian assistance 2017-2020, as well as the humanitarian needs identified in Sida\u2019s humanitarian crises analyses for 2018. \n\nSida is also suggesting a multi-year contribution to NRC\u2019s Rapid Response Mechanism, to allow for a timely response to sudden onset situations or escalating crises.   \n\nFurthermore, Sida suggests a two-year financial contribution to the NRC-led Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC), which strives to increase knowledge on the needs of internally displaced, and one-year contributions to the NRC/NORCAP managed project \u201cStrengthening capacity for use of cash- and market based responses in humanitarian action\u201d, to NRC's internal work on \"Digital Transformation\" and to NRC\u2019s work on humanitarian policy, which includes work to strengthen the global humanitarian system and NGO participation in the system.\n\nSida also proposes to channel funds through NRC for the support of three NGO platforms; the Jordan INGO Forum (JIF), the Lebanon Humanitarian INGO Forum (LHIF) and the International Association of Development Agencies (AIDA).  In regard to AIDA, the Consulate General in Jerusalem has the intention to provide support for AIDA within the framework of the cooperation strategy for Palestine. Efficiency gains can be achieved by providing the support through the NRC-Sida humanitarian unit cooperation agreement, and it is thus suggested that Sida/HUM channels this limited development funding, with funding delegated from Palestine Strategy, decision number XXX XXXX\n\nNRC\u2019s target group is mainly comprised of refugees and internally displaced persons but also when relevant, host communities and returnees. NRC is working within its six core competencies (sectors); shelter, livelihoods and food security, education, water and sanitation, camp management and legal advice.\n\nSida and NRC have collaborated since 2005. NRC was granted Sida Strategic Partnership in 2013. NRC is an important partner for Sida as the organisation operates in some of the world's most difficult humanitarian crises. NRC was during 2017 Sidas/Hums largest humanitarian CSO partner, and is expected to remain so in 2018.\n\nSida\u2019s support to NRC comprises a three year agreement for humanitarian activities, for which funding is decided each year based on Sida\u2019s allocation process and NRC\u2019s yearly application. Additional funding is granted through supplementary decisions throughout the year.\nApart from the flexible support offered through the Program Based Approach, NRC may reallocate up to 10 % of funds between RRM-projects in the same country and within individual project budgets. For changes above 10 %, Sida\u2019s prior written approval is needed.\n\nUPDATE 2021\nIncreasingly NRC is developing its programming on the basis of a gender analysis. It is mainstreaming gender across its 6 core competencies of the humanitarian response. The reporting is still to be improved for capturing performances and outcomes regarding the gender perspective in NRC's programmes. NRC is not yet equipped to track the age dimension of the gender perspective in its monitoring framework, but will address this gap as recommended by Sida.\n\nThis partnership agreement was extended to 31 December 2020 for the activity period. In 2020, NRC received 402.7 mkr in total for its humanitarian programmes and projects, including 330.9 mkr for crisis response in 26 settings, 50 mkr for RRMs and 21.8 mkr for capacity development. Bringing the total of this partnership to 1,306,200,000 kr for the 2017-2020 cycle.",

        "title": "SRC Agreement 2017-2019",
        "description": "On January 27, 2017 the Swedish Red Cross (SRC) submitted an application to Sida for the above-mentioned program with an initial budget of 167.5 MSEK for 2017, 16 MSEK for 2018 and 16 MSK for 2019. The overall objective of the program is to strengthen the resilience of people and communities to crises, and their capacity to recover afterwards, and to reduce the risk that people and communities are affected by crises and disasters. A novelty of the new agreement period is that three country-projects (Afghanistan, DR Congo and Myanmar) are offered multiyear financing as they are protracted crises with a need for preidictable finansing to secure necessary resources and ensure predictability and contextspecific impact.\n\nFunds allocated for 2017 will be disbursed in two different payments, after signature of the agreement and after 1 September 2017, following approval of implementation of the action plan established by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies regarding internal management and control. Funds allocated for Ukraine and for a scaled up response in South Sudan (from a budget of 4,5 MSEK to13,5 MSEK) will be disbursed after the SRC has provided Sida with, and Sida's approval of, additional applications for these contexts, and after the SRC has demonstrated in written that the corruption case in Ukraine has been investigated and closed and after Sida's approval of the investigation and its recommendations. \n\nThe SRC is part of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement made up of 190 Red Cross and Red Crescent national societies, the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Federation (IFRC) and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). Sida provides support to the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement through two channels: the ICRC and the SRC. The SRC channels most of Sida's support to national societies, the IFRC and the ICRC and works in longterm partnership with forteen countries: Cameroon, DR Congo, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, DPRK, Myanmar, Iraq, Palestine, Syria, Yemen and Ukraine. \n\nThe SRC\u2019s strategic cooperation with partners within the movement - with other National Societies (NS), IFRC and the ICRC \u2013 is essential and gives the SRC the possibility to work at both global and local levels. The SRC is in addition considered to have systems, expertise and capacity to strengthen the local capacity of NS to predict and prevent disasters, as well as to contribute to rapid humanitarian assistance in sudden crises. The SRC has faced difficulties in demonstrating the humanitarian relevance of the Sida-funded programs as they are often situated between humanitarian action and long-term development. The SRC\u2019s new humanitarian strategy 2016-2019 does, however, put a greater focus on humanitarian operations and this new approach is reflected in the organisation\u2019s application 2017-2019. Several programmes with a long-term development focus have been removed in the application for funding from Sida, and new initiatives with a sharper humanitarian focus have been included, such as Yemen and Cameroon (programme targeting CAR refugees). It will be important to follow up on this positive direction towards a strengthened humanitarian relevance to the Sida-funded projects to ensure its continuation.\n\nSupport planned for 2017 includes long-term programs in various fields such as health, disaster prevention, resilience, sanitation, organizational development, volunteer development and planning, monitoring, evaluation and results (PMER). The support also includes regional support to the IFRC\u2019s different cluster- and regional offices in Africa, Asia and MENA. Thematic- and capacity enhancement support will in 2017 focus on disaster reduction, volunteering in conflict and disaster, water and sanitation, health, and gender and diversity. Through support in the form of Sida's Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM), the SRC will also be able to respond to rapid onsets of disasters. \n\nThe program proposal for 2017 includes:\nWEST- AND CENTRAL AFRICA REGIONAL SUPPORT: 1,3 MSEK\nCAMEROON: 2 MSEK\nDR CONGO: 5 MSEK \nEAST- AND SOUTH AFRICA REGIONAL SUPPORT: 2,1 MSEK\nEAST AFRICA CLUSTER (Nairobi): 2,5 MSEK\nSOMALIA: 4 MSEK \nSOUTH SUDAN: 13,5 MSEK\nSUDAN: 4 MSEK\nASIA PACIFIC REGIONAL SUPPORT: 5,8 MSEK\nAFGHANISTAN: 6,5 MSEK\nBANGLADESH: 6 MSEK\nDPRK: 4,5 MSEK\nMYANMAR: 4,5 MSEK \nMENA REGIONAL SUPPORT: 4,3 MSEK\nIRAQ: 7 MSEK\nPALESTINE: 3 MSEK\nSYRIA INCLUDING Lebanon och Jordan: 30 MSEK \nYEMEN: 4,5 MSEK \nUKRAINE: 5 MSEK\nCAPACITY- OCH METHOD SUPPORT: 7,9 MSEK \nRRM-SUPPORT: 40 MSEK\nSUPPORT FOR THE DREF: 500 000 SEK \nSPECIAL INTERVENTIONS/ICRC DELEGATES: 3,6 MSEK\n\nThe program proposal for 2018 includes:\nDR CONGO: 5 MSEK \nAFGHANISTAN: 6,5 MSEK\nMYANMAR: 4,5 MSEK \n\nThe program proposal for 2019 includes:\nDR CONGO: 5 MSEK \nAFGHANISTAN: 6,5 MSEK\nMYANMAR: 4,5 MSEK \n\nOut of Sida's initial support for 2017 totalling 167.5 MSEK, 61.4 % (103.5 MSEK) will be channelled to the IFRC and 2.6 % (4,5 MSEK) to the ICRC. Approximately 5.5 % (9.3 MSEK) consists of projects that the SRC supports in consortia and where funds are allocated through partner NS such as British, Australian and Danish Red Cross. Approximately 8.9 % (15.0 MSEK) will be channelled directly to NS (e.g., DRC and Palestinian RC, further contributions go to a number of NS for the management of SRC delegates in-country costs). Approximately 21.6 % (36.3 MSEK) out of the total budget goes directly to the SRC, of which 14.8 % (25 MSEK) for staff costs (technical delegates and program officers) and 7 % to operational support costs (11.3 MSEK).",

In this appraisal, Sida makes the assessment that the proposed programme is relevant in relation to the Strategy for Sweden\u00b4s Humanitarian Assistance provided through Sida 2017 - 2020, and that a three-year agreement on strategic partnership should be entered into between Sida and SMC for the period 1 April 2017 - 31 March 2020.\n\nIn its proposal for 2017, SMC has applied for a total amount of 46,5 million SEK which includes 1) work in six countries (35,5 million SEK); 2) interventions through the Rapid Response Mechanism (10 million SEK); and 3) capacity development support (1 million SEK). During 2017 SMC proposes to work with four member organizations which are ADRA (Adventist Development and Relief Agency), IAS (International Aid Services), CCS (Christian Council of Sweden) and PMU (Pingsmissionens utvecklingssamarbete). \n\nSMC, founded in 1912, is an ecumenical membership-based organization with 35 member organizations who are active in 46 countries. The organization is engaged in both development work and humanitarian assistance and became a framework organization for Sida/CIVSAM already in 1980, while the strategic partnership with Sida in terms of humanitarian assistance was initiated as late as 2014. The 35 members are Swedish churches and Christian organizations with long histories of international work - the role of SMC is generally to support, facilitate and coordinate these partner organizations and their local partners\u00b4 work.",

        "description": "The intervention targets several development problems in Somalia. The financial sector in Somalia is underdeveloped. Banks practice an exclusive approach towards lending that only occurs to the few that can provide collateral. Financing costs are high and allow only short-term financing. The majority of the population, and especially women and young people, are excluded from the financial sector due to lack of collateral and perceived risk level. This in turn has a major negative impact on micro, small and medium sized businesses, MSMEs and its conditions for employment and creating jobs. This initiative is expected to open up for access to finance for MSMEs, thereby contributing to job creation, especially for women and youth, in Somalia.\nSeveral on-going programs, including the World Bank's Somalia Core Economic Institutions and Opportunities Program (SCORE), supported by Sweden among several other donors, work to address issues related to the legal framework and legal review, as well as formalization of the financial sector, but no intervention is targeting the problem of access to finance and cost of credit. The biggest casualties of this are MSME's which are widely recognized as key drivers of new job creation and overall economic growth. Therefore, the objective of this intervention is to reduce poverty in Somalia through enterprise growth and employment creation. MSME, especially with focus on women and young people, will be able to benefit from formal banking system and the Somali financial will be able to benefit from more long-term clients, which in turn will provide much needed growth capital for expansion, employment and contribute to resilience. \nIn the long run, it is expected to contribute to a change in Financial Institutions' lending attitudes to include a broader segment of clients and recognize on their part that this makes good business sense. For MSMEs this is expected to provide resources for sustainable job creation as they benefit from what can become a long-term relationship with the financial institutions.\nThe intervention intends to provide credit guarantees in order to incentivize lending to merit worthy MSME applicants in any sector that lack sufficient collateral. To achieve this, Sida will provide a guarantee to One Earth Future Foundation (OEF), which will be Sida's agreement partner. OEF is an American NGO with projects in Somalia, among other fragile countries. The work in Somalia is handled under a project called Shuraako. Shuraako work to facilitate investments in promising Somali-based businesses. OEF will in turn sign separate agreements with the three (out of currently six) Somali financial institutions: Dahabshil Bank, Premier Bank and International Bank of Somalia, but additional financial institutions may be added during the guarantee period.\nThe three banks are the ones who give loans to the target group by utilizing the risk sharing set-up of the guarantee. The guarantee to OEF means that the banks\u00b4 risk is reduced for up to 70% in case the loan is not repaid while the bank takes the remaining 30%. OEF estimates that approximately 260 loans will be guaranteed and over 2000 jobs will be created during the five-year project period.\nThis 5 million USD Guarantee is complemented by a grant to OEF for Technical Assistance (TA) that will be provided to the banks and MSMEs, including OEFs operational costs for managing and following up the guarantee instrument. The grant component is considered essential for achieving the goal of this intervention. The Guarantee instrument and Grant component will be handled in two separate agreements where the Grant Agreement is handled by the Embassy.",

For MSMEs this is expected to provide resources for sustainable job creation as they benefit from what can become a long-term relationship with the financial institutions.\nThe intervention intends to provide credit guarantees in order to incentivize lending to merit worthy MSME applicants in any sector that lack sufficient collateral. To achieve this, Sida will provide a guarantee to One Earth Future Foundation (OEF), which will be Sida's agreement partner. OEF is an American NGO with projects in Somalia, among other fragile countries. The work in Somalia is handled under a project called Shuraako. Shuraako work to facilitate investments in promising Somali-based businesses. OEF will in turn sign separate agreements with the three (out of currently six) Somali financial institutions: Dahabshil Bank, Premier Bank and International Bank of Somalia, but additional financial institutions may be added during the guarantee period.\nThe three banks are the ones who give loans to the target group by utilizing the risk sharing set-up of the guarantee. The guarantee to OEF means that the banks\u00b4 risk is reduced for up to 70% in case the loan is not repaid while the bank takes the remaining 30%. OEF estimates that approximately 260 loans will be guaranteed and over 2000 jobs will be created during the five-year project period.\nThis 5 million USD Guarantee is complemented by a grant to OEF for Technical Assistance (TA) that will be provided to the banks and MSMEs, including OEFs operational costs for managing and following up the guarantee instrument. The grant component is considered essential for achieving the goal of this intervention. The Guarantee instrument and Grant component will be handled in two separate agreements where the Grant Agreement is handled by the Embassy.",

        "description": "Life & Peace Institute has developed a proposal for the program 'Multi-Level Conflict Transformation in South Central Somalia'. The program covers the period 2017-2019 and the total budget for the program is SEK 35 400 000. LPI applying for support from Sida / Embassy in Nairobi for the program of which Sweden is funding 44% of the total budget 80 356 743 SEK. LPI has applied for EU funding through their call for proposals that are taking place during March 2017. LPI is applying for funding together with the Somali partner Somali Peace Line (SPL). LPI is currently investigating other potential donors. LPI has adjusted the current planning for 2017 to fit with the proposed support from Sida (and EU funds for CRM Phase II). The program is currently underfunded by 26%.\n\nThe head of the development cooperation with Somalia hereby makes a decision to divert from the requirement of bringing the appraisal for assessment in the Embassy common quality assurance committee QAC. Although the proposed budget exceeds the amount of 20MSEK that requires the intervention to be assessed in the embassy Committee, it is hereby decided to divert from this requirement based on Sida's good record of cooperation with LPI from the support of its Somalia program as well as global programs, as well as the time-pressured situation where funding to address the drought situation and famine should be given priority. The proposal, has however been taken up for discussion in the Somali Section's internal committee where it was assessed as highly relevant and with the recommendation that a decision to be taken on support.\n\nDue to the fact that Sweden's strategy for development cooperation with Somalia expires after 2017 and a new strategy is planned for the periode between 2018-2021, Sida is restricted to commit to funding for years beyond 2019. Consequently, Sida and LPI will enter into agreement for the period 2017-2019 with the option to extend the agreement with addition of funds for the year 2020.\n\nThe proposal also includes an integrated component of emergency aid to the ongoing and severe drought that hit the country in 2016 and continues to pose a threat in 2017. According to LPI, this response, with activities such as the rehabilitation of irrigation canals, job creation efforts, health nutritional packages, cholera prevention, hygiene training, food ration and the distribution of food parcels, knowledge about basic health program and services, strengthening social cohesion etc., constitutes a prerequisite to conduct the comprehensive peace building work in the areas that are the hardest hit by the drought. This initiative will run for three months and be reported separately (narrative, financial) in the first half-year reporting. LPI will forward 5,4MSEK to ZamZam Foundation (ZZF) for implementation of their drought response between April to June 2017. A separate reporting for the Three month emergency response is expected in August 2017. The audit of the funds to the emergency response will be covered in the annual audit. \n \nThe proposal builds upon the positive results from the program Conflict Transformation (2013-2016; extended to Feb 2017), namely;\n- Reduction in violent clashes and addressing intra and inter-clan conflicts across 5 regions of south central Somalia;\n- Peace agreements reached;\n- Women's increased inclusion in peacebuilding processes;\n- LPI\u2019s civil society partners demonstrated increased peacebuilding capacity;\n- Analysis and lessons on the importance of bottom-up peacebuilding and community engagement in statebuilding and the need for inclusive peace processes that engage a wide range of stakeholders across political divides, have been fed directly into key policy arenas at local, national and international levels. LPI has also contributed to regional debates on humanitarian conflict sensitivity.\n\nAs part of the Mid-Term Review conducted by Sipu in 2015, some recommendations for improvement were highlighted of which all have been addressed by LPI and consequently formed the proposal for the 2017-2019 program.\n-Strengthen inclusivity, such as mainstreaming and directly influencing social practices and norms so peace processes are more inclusive of all marginalised groups.\n- Encourage adoption of transparent, democratic processes that create space for broad representation and enable people to express their needs and priorities, e.g. through separate consultations or dialogues amongst specific groups, careful validation from communities regarding those chosen to represent them, and/or objective leader report back mechanisms to communities after dialogues.\n-LPI and partners will sensitively accommodate cultural norms and processes, whilst simultaneously influencing, renovating and expanding them. \n-Strengthen scenario planning with partners and communities so intentional planning for inevitable crises and their management is better built into the evolution of long-term peace processes. \n-Ensuringing local peace processes facilitated as part of programme to make use of opportunities to bring in other stakeholders, such as local authorities, government, or non-state actors in control of areas in appropriate ways that do not disempower local communities or clans, but encourages shared responsibility by all stakeholders. \n-The programme will adopt approaches that identify where these tensions become manifest intentionally explore with communities acceptable responses that address and/or resolve them.\n-The combination of developing a common deep understanding of the issues, mutual moral support, standing alongside partners and mutual capacity building is critical in developing trust, programme effectiveness and appropriate adaptive iterative approaches to complex contextual developments.\n\nThe overall objective of the program is to contribute to stability and peace in Somalia by supporting reconciliation processes which address the causes of grievance and conflict at the local level, reinforced by dedicated policy actors which promotes peace frameworks and state-building efforts.\n\nThe strategic priorities and methods for achieving the overall objectives are capacity development of civil society, including women's advocacy towards decision makers within the government as well as those who otherwise preparing policies in the field, the development and strengthening of conflict prevention mechanisms, the promotion of a culture of tolerance and research.\n\nThe method to achieve the overall objectives is assessed to be in accordance with the Swedish strategies and policies for Somalia and for the thematic area of human security.

        "title": "Somalia Stability Fund Phase II 2018-2020",
        "description": "The Somalia Stability Fund has developed a new strategy for a phase II of its initiative to build up the conditions for a stable Somalia with the potential to develop the society by political, social and financial means. \n\nSSF phase II is developed as a flexible program which is shaped so as to adapt its approach by new learning to a dynamic context. Phase II will implement a Problem-Driven Iterative Adaptation Model (PDIA) which identifies the root causes to the instability in Somalia and solutions are developed on a case-by-case basis. The aim of this model is to generate a sequence of iterative solutions, in other Words, investments and adaptations will be based on previous lessons learned and experiences so as to enable a proper response.\n\nThe Theory of Change (ToC) for phase II claims that:\nIf the stability in newly recovered areas in Somalia is improved by a strengthened relation between societies, an increased trust for the government, and a reduced risk for revolt among the population -If governmental institutions gain increased legitimacy - through the participation of women and marginalized Groups, representation and ability to establish a broad normative framework over their jurisdiction - and an increased capacity - characterized by increased effectiveness, profitability, and the state's accountability of core functions - and; If the communities' vulnerabilities to conflict reduce through the implementation of grievance redress mechanisms, and support to actors for Peace; Then, the stability in Somalia will improve since the state institutions are more inclusive, more legitimate, and better able to perform its tasks, the vulnerabilities to conflict have reduced and the possibilities for social and economic development are available for the larger population.\n\nThe Theory of Change (ToC) is based on Three pillars:\n1. Stabilization (The stability in the newly recovered areas is strengthened, which is characterized by improved relations between Clans, improved trust and confidence in the government, and a reduced capacity for revolt);\n2. Statebuilding (State institutions have an increased legitimacy which is characterized by inclusiveness, representation and participation; and which has an increased capacity which is characterized by the ability to establish a broad normative framework over their jurisdictions, and an increased effectiveness of state core functions);\n3. Conflict prevention and administration (The communities' vulnerabilities to conflicts have reduced through grievance redress mechanisms as well as support to actors for peace).\nThe overall impact of phase II is to improve the stability in Somalia through more inclusive, more legitimate and better capable state institutions to perform their tasks, and the vulnerabilities to conflicts have reduced and the possibilities for social and economic development are available for the wider population. The Somalia Stability Fund supports activities in newly recovered areas through trustbuilding for the government as well as improved social cohesion as part of the statebuilding process.\nThe fund is in a good position to support capacity building and strenghten the legitimacy within administrations. With its ability to connect the political engagement with the Project financial support, SSF becomes specifically relevant to support inclusive settlements through support to:\n- marginalized areas;\n- job Creation;\n- rehabilitation of infrastructure;\n- integration of state administrations.\n\nThe niche of SSF is to invest in long-term capacity building so as to develop the core functions within the state. Particularly, the SSF is able to build administrative Control and provide infrastructural services (especially at the local level); and with a small grant support to a legal monopoly of the use of violence (especially through collaboration with the UN and bilateral programs to adapt the police to underinvested areas); rule of law; and market Creations, especially protection of land rights; and the management of public finances.\n\nPhase II of SSF aims to prevent and resolve conflicts through conflict and gender sensitive approach. The fund has particular abilities to support states by acting as mediator. It also has the possibility to bring added value to the UN and bilateral programs which support the judicial system through a discussion-based approach, as well as the possibility to develop institution-building which contributes as a mediator in land disputes or women's access to legal support. The support to youth employment is also a comparative advantage for the fund due to its ability to deliver innovative partnerships within the private sector.\n\nThe Fund which is donor-driven will be supported by Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, the EU, Germany, and DFID. Sweden is through this decision allocating a total of SEK 40,000,000 between 2018-2020.",

        "description": "This programme is implemented during a five-year period (as framework organizations may now apply for grants for longer periods than in the past in order to increase aid effectiveness) and it is based on Diakonia's global strategy for 2015-2020. It includes 21 country programs in Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Middle East, and six regional programs and a new global program for innovation in the area of \"social and economic justice.\" Diakonia is working through local civil society organizations for the overall goal to change unfair structures that generate and uphold inequality, oppression and violence and to work for fulfilment of the right of all people to live a life in dignity. In total 216 partner organizations are included in this application. Operations are focused on the following six areas: human rights (HR), democracy, equality, social and economic justice, conflict and justice, as well as capacity development of partners. What is new compared to the previous contribution is primarily the inclusion of several new regional programs in various areas as well as the global innovation program.\n\nExpected results:\nGeneral expected results are formulated for the six areas. These are linked to the expected results for each program (i.e. by country / regional / global program), which in many cases consist of a selection of results that are identical to the general results. The results at the program level are concretized through indicators.\n\nExamples of expected outcomes, one from each region, in some common thematic areas are:\n\n\"Mali: Women's political participation has been strengthened at the local and national levels\" (democracy)\n\n\"Bolivia: Gender-based violence has decreased\" (gender equality)\n\n\"Bangladesh: The conditions for decent work and fair income have improved\" (social and economic justice)\n\n\"Lebanon: The capacity of Diakonia's partners to integrate environment and conflict sensitivity in their work (where relevant) has been improved.\" (capacity development)\n\nPrevious results:\nReports often show results in terms of strengthened rights holders and increased capacity of partner organizations.\n\nThe following examples show previous results in a few areas:\n\nHuman rights: In Thailand five partner organizations assisted tens of thousands of stateless persons to obtain legal status. This means that they for example have the right to work and study, as well as to access rights-based services.\n\nDemocracy: In Mali, partner organizations were trained in citizen budget monitoring and analysis of public policies. This has led to increased budgets for health and education in several municipalities. In one province all municipalities published their accounting in 2014, whereas in 2012 none of the municipalities did.\n\nConflict and Justice: Seven partner organizations in Colombia, Honduras and Peru have increased their knowledge of the legal framework and have taken legal action, which in some cases resulted in the return to communities of pieces of land from extractive companies.\n\nThe basis for Sida's assessment:\nIn connection with the assessment of the application a lawyer at Sida's legal unit has been consulted for examination of the draft agreement. The controller at Sida's Unit for Civil Society has been consulted for budgetary matters etc. Comments have also been requested from Swedish missions abroad (UM) and other units at Sida which manage bilateral agreements with Diakonia. In addition, reviews have been carried out of the mainstreaming of cross-cutting issues in Diakonia's operations through Sida's framework agreement for gender equality, Sida\u2019s help desk for environment and climate change, and Sida\u2019s help desk for human security.\n\nSida's assessment of Diakonia's application is based primarily on the following documents:\n- Final report of the organizational assessment for qualification as Sida\u2019s framework organization of Diakonia 2013 (Doxno. 027413/13)\n- Diakonia's final report to CIVSAM for the framework contribution 2012-2014 (Doxno. 016518/15, 035857/15)\n- Documentation from 12 UM, and two units at Sida (for Doxno. see section 7a in the appraisal of intervention).\n- Documents related to the audit process of Diakonia for 2012 and 2013 (Doxno. 016523/13, 019056/14, 019049/14, 034408/14)\n- Sample Audit of Diakonia in Zimbabwe in 2013 (Doxno. 034075/14) and in the DRC in 2015 (Doxno. 039612/15)\n- Sampling of Diakonia\u2019s management of deviations in Guatemala in 2015 (Doxno. 045514/15):\n- Study of mainstreaming of gender equality (Doxno. 037480/15)\n- Study of mainstreaming of environment and climate (Doxno. 037484/15)\n- Review of mainstreaming of conflict sensitivity (Doxno. 038604/15)\n- Evaluation of Diakonia's work on gender equality \"Walking the Talk\" 2014 (Doxno. 038478/14)",

It includes 21 country programs in Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Middle East, and six regional programs and a new global program for innovation in the area of \"social and economic justice.\" Diakonia is working through local civil society organizations for the overall goal to change unfair structures that generate and uphold inequality, oppression and violence and to work for fulfilment of the right of all people to live a life in dignity. In total 216 partner organizations are included in this application. Operations are focused on the following six areas: human rights (HR), democracy, equality, social and economic justice, conflict and justice, as well as capacity development of partners. What is new compared to the previous contribution is primarily the inclusion of several new regional programs in various areas as well as the global innovation program.\n\nExpected results:\nGeneral expected results are formulated for the six areas. These are linked to the expected results for each program (i.e. by country / regional / global program), which in many cases consist of a selection of results that are identical to the general results. The results at the program level are concretized through indicators.\n\nExamples of expected outcomes, one from each region, in some common thematic areas are:\n\n\"Mali: Women's political participation has been strengthened at the local and national levels\" (democracy)\n\n\"Bolivia: Gender-based violence has decreased\" (gender equality)\n\n\"Bangladesh: The conditions for decent work and fair income have improved\" (social and economic justice)\n\n\"Lebanon: The capacity of Diakonia's partners to integrate environment and conflict sensitivity in their work (where relevant) has been improved.\" (capacity development)\n\nPrevious results:\nReports often show results in terms of strengthened rights holders and increased capacity of partner organizations.\n\nThe following examples show previous results in a few areas:\n\nHuman rights: In Thailand five partner organizations assisted tens of thousands of stateless persons to obtain legal status. This means that they for example have the right to work and study, as well as to access rights-based services.\n\nDemocracy: In Mali, partner organizations were trained in citizen budget monitoring and analysis of public policies. This has led to increased budgets for health and education in several municipalities. In one province all municipalities published their accounting in 2014, whereas in 2012 none of the municipalities did.\n\nConflict and Justice: Seven partner organizations in Colombia, Honduras and Peru have increased their knowledge of the legal framework and have taken legal action, which in some cases resulted in the return to communities of pieces of land from extractive companies.\n\nThe basis for Sida's assessment:\nIn connection with the assessment of the application a lawyer at Sida's legal unit has been consulted for examination of the draft agreement. The controller at Sida's Unit for Civil Society has been consulted for budgetary matters etc. Comments have also been requested from Swedish missions abroad (UM) and other units at Sida which manage bilateral agreements with Diakonia.

With OPC's 27 member organisations (MOs) it co-operates with people and organisations throughout the World, with the purpose to achieve progressive development for democracy, equality and sustainability. Sida has a longstanding cooperation with OPC.\n\nIn October 2019 OPC submitted a proposal to Sida under the Strategy for Support via Swedish Civil Society organisations for the period 2020-2024, and the Strategy for Sweden's for development cooperation with Myanmar 2018-2022. The overall objective of OPC's proposal is to \"achieve progressive development for democracy, equality and sustainability.\" The proposal includes nine programmes. The number of local partners organisations is approximately 120. The grand total budget for the five-year period is 613 MSEK (including own contribution), of which 486 MSEK is applied from the CSO Strategy, and 82 MSEK is applied from the Myanmar Strategy.\n\nBy the following five political priorities the OPC and its partners contribute to poverty reduction;\n- Countering the threats to democracy and human rights \n- Advancing equality and worker\u2019s rights \u2013 building new alliances and pushing progressive politics \n- Sustainability through a just transition \u2013 countering climate change \n- Promoting peace and dialogue \u2013 mitigating armed conflict and social tensions \n- Opposing the backlash \u2013 increasing gender equality\n\nThe applied budget from the CSO-strategy is an increase by 21%, compared to the last funding period 2016-2019. The reasons for the increase are: expanded operations in most regions, increased local presence in several regions, shift from project-based focus to supporting organisations, including core support, much more labour intense application of RBM due to the shift to adaptive management.\n\nSida assess the proposal to be relevant to the CSO-strategy and the Myanmar Strategy. The proposed changes in the operations are assessed to be positive by Sida. Sida proposes that the OPC is granted to 458 000 000 SEK for the implementation of the programme for the period of 2020-2024. Of these funds, a total of 60 000 000 SEK is allocated for operations in Myanmar for the period 2020-2024.",

        "description": "This is an intervention for the continued support of MSEK 475 to the \"UN Multi-Partnership Trust Fund\" (MPTF) for Somalia in 2018-2019. In Decision 2016-002435, dated 30 June 2015, Sida decided to support MPTF 2015-2017 with an amount of 140 MSEK. Following the decision 52/16 from November 2016, an additional 33 MSEK was added and an additional  55 MSEK through decision 14/17, dated April 24, 2017 and finally 10 MSEK was added in Dwecember 2017 through decision 58/2017. Sida assess that the MPTF and the joint programs that Sweden contributes to delivers results despite some challenges that comes with implementation of programmes in a difficult context.\n\nSomalia is one of the poorest countries in the world and is characterized by inequality. Recurrent humanitarian crises and armed conflicts pose challenging to the development of the country. Furthermore, Somalia is affected by climate change and recurring periods of drought. 2.3 million people have insecure food supplies and there are over one million internally displaced persons. Of a population of about 12 million, over 70% are poor and more than 40% live in extreme poverty. One of seven children dies before their first birthday; one of eighteen women die in childbirth; and only one in three persons have access to safe drinking water. Over 70% of Somalia's population is under thirty years and lack employment opportunities which leave many of them with few prospects for the future. Women are structurally discriminated and gender based violence is widespread. Somalia has the highest incidence of female genital mutilation in the world. Women also lack access to justice that can protect their interests. The lack of a formal and effective legal justice system in most parts of the country has led to extensive impunity. In 2017, Somalia was ranked as the most corrupt country in the world according to Transparency International.\n\nHowever, a relatively peaceful political process for state building has begun. The increasing international support in recent years has contributed to progress in many areas. The implementation of the indirect parliamentary election held in the fall of 2016 with increased political representation of women in addition to the presidential elections in February 2017 followed by a peaceful change of power are particularly positive signs.\n\nThe MPTF was established in 2015 with Sweden as one of the first donors. The fund currently manages a total of USD 200 million. The two biggest donors are the EU followed by UK. So far, Sweden has contributed with 238 MSEK during the period and is thereby the third largest donor to the fund. During the period 2015-2017, Sweden has supported the central political processes (elections, constitution, parliament and the new federal state formation), the development of the judiciary, job creation for young people, and public administration. Furthermore, Sweden has provided support to the UN's core functions to enable effective implementation in a challenging context like Somalia. In addition, pilot support for the fund's so-called \"national window\", to use Somalia\u2019s own country systems have been successfully supported to a prison rehabilitation facility, supplementing the above-mentioned legal aid program. Despite challenges on an overall level, it is Sida's assessment that these programs together deliver results.\n\nMoreover, Sida assess that the MPTF is now fully established and that the programmes that are funded are implemented satisfactory. The international community has made significant commitments. Somalia has developed a National Development Plan (NDP) for Somalia 2017-2019. In addition, a Security Pact was adopted at the Somalia Conference held in May 2017 in London. The Security Pact sets out the roadmap for a Comprehensive Approach to Security, CAS. Hence, the UN has developed its own strategic plan (UNSF) for Somalia that reflects both the NDP and CAS. The MPTF is the main funding mechanism for UN support the implementation on the UNSF.\n\nSida assess that the MPTF continues to be relevant and appropriate mechanism to deliver support. Based on Sweden's development cooperation strategy for Somalia and the new Strategy to come, Sida proposes that the continued support to the MPTF shall be earmarked for the following thematic areas and for the programs decided in the framework of these:\n1. Including policies, governance and federal state building, as well as reconciliation\n2. Human rights, women, peace and security\n3. Economic recovery and resilience\n4. Reproductive, maternity and child health and rights\n\nWithin the area of Reproductive, maternity and child health and rights, 140 MSEK will be earmarked to UNFPA\u2019s country programme for Somalia 2018-2020. For more information on the assessment of UNFPA as a strategic partner to Sida in Somalia, pleas se decision 28/2017, dated 2017-06-22. In addition, 60 MSEK shall be earmarked for the so-called \"Enablers Program\", which includes support for the UN Risk Management Unit, the UN department for Security, and the Resident Coordinator's Office (RCO), which is considered to be crucial for implementation of all development efforts in Somalia. \n\nHowever, the MPTF is not only a financing mechanism but also constitutes a platform for donor coordination in a broader sense since it includes the major actors such as the EU, UK, US, NO, DE, and DK. At the same time, there is a trend that the EU and the UK are launching new bilateral programs in certain areas, while other donors such as DE will expand their support in favor of the MPTF. The MPTF is an important and a key instrument for cooperation between the international community and the Federal Government of Somalia to realize the overall development goals of sustainable peace and development in Somalia.\n\nThe MPTF will harmonize and align the significant resources that are channeled through the UN in Somalia and as such it is foreseen to a more effective international support for Somalia. If the international community, the FSG and other stakeholders cooperate to reduce the risks, it is Sida's assessment that objectives will be reached to a reasonable extent despite the complex context and the many challenges it entails.\n\nThe draft agreement follows that between the UNDP and Sida agreed template for the current form of cooperation. The new standard Standard Administrative Arrangement, SAA will regulate Sweden's contribution to the MPTF. The SAA will be signed by Sida and UNDP as the administrative agent. A Terms of Reference for the MPTF as well as a Memorandum of Understanding between all implementation UN partners are attached. Sida\u2019s conditions in the contribution management rule are thereby fulfilled. Furthermore, a Memorandum of Agreement has been signed between the Government of Somalia and UNDP as an administrative agent.",

        "description": "This is an intervention for the continued support of MSEK 475 to the \"UN Multi-Partnership Trust Fund\" (MPTF) for Somalia in 2018-2019. In Decision 2016-002435, dated 30 June 2015, Sida decided to support MPTF 2015-2017 with an amount of 140 MSEK. Following the decision 52/16 from November 2016, an additional 33 MSEK was added and an additional  55 MSEK through decision 14/17, dated April 24, 2017 and finally 10 MSEK was added in Dwecember 2017 through decision 58/2017. Sida assess that the MPTF and the joint programs that Sweden contributes to delivers results despite some challenges that comes with implementation of programmes in a difficult context.\n\nSomalia is one of the poorest countries in the world and is characterized by inequality. Recurrent humanitarian crises and armed conflicts pose challenging to the development of the country. Furthermore, Somalia is affected by climate change and recurring periods of drought. 2.3 million people have insecure food supplies and there are over one million internally displaced persons. Of a population of about 12 million, over 70% are poor and more than 40% live in extreme poverty. One of seven children dies before their first birthday; one of eighteen women die in childbirth; and only one in three persons have access to safe drinking water. Over 70% of Somalia's population is under thirty years and lack employment opportunities which leave many of them with few prospects for the future. Women are structurally discriminated and gender based violence is widespread. Somalia has the highest incidence of female genital mutilation in the world. Women also lack access to justice that can protect their interests. The lack of a formal and effective legal justice system in most parts of the country has led to extensive impunity. In 2017, Somalia was ranked as the most corrupt country in the world according to Transparency International.\n\nHowever, a relatively peaceful political process for state building has begun. The increasing international support in recent years has contributed to progress in many areas. The implementation of the indirect parliamentary election held in the fall of 2016 with increased political representation of women in addition to the presidential elections in February 2017 followed by a peaceful change of power are particularly positive signs.\n\nThe MPTF was established in 2015 with Sweden as one of the first donors. The fund currently manages a total of USD 200 million. The two biggest donors are the EU followed by UK. So far, Sweden has contributed with 238 MSEK during the period and is thereby the third largest donor to the fund. During the period 2015-2017, Sweden has supported the central political processes (elections, constitution, parliament and the new federal state formation), the development of the judiciary, job creation for young people, and public administration. Furthermore, Sweden has provided support to the UN's core functions to enable effective implementation in a challenging context like Somalia. In addition, pilot support for the fund's so-called \"national window\", to use Somalia\u2019s own country systems have been successfully supported to a prison rehabilitation facility, supplementing the above-mentioned legal aid program. Despite challenges on an overall level, it is Sida's assessment that these programs together deliver results.\n\nMoreover, Sida assess that the MPTF is now fully established and that the programmes that are funded are implemented satisfactory. The international community has made significant commitments. Somalia has developed a National Development Plan (NDP) for Somalia 2017-2019. In addition, a Security Pact was adopted at the Somalia Conference held in May 2017 in London. The Security Pact sets out the roadmap for a Comprehensive Approach to Security, CAS. Hence, the UN has developed its own strategic plan (UNSF) for Somalia that reflects both the NDP and CAS. The MPTF is the main funding mechanism for UN support the implementation on the UNSF.\n\nSida assess that the MPTF continues to be relevant and appropriate mechanism to deliver support. Based on Sweden's development cooperation strategy for Somalia and the new Strategy to come, Sida proposes that the continued support to the MPTF shall be earmarked for the following thematic areas and for the programs decided in the framework of these:\n1. Including policies, governance and federal state building, as well as reconciliation\n2. Human rights, women, peace and security\n3. Economic recovery and resilience\n4. Reproductive, maternity and child health and rights\n\nWithin the area of Reproductive, maternity and child health and rights, 140 MSEK will be earmarked to UNFPA\u2019s country programme for Somalia 2018-2020. For more information on the assessment of UNFPA as a strategic partner to Sida in Somalia, pleas se decision 28/2017, dated 2017-06-22. In addition, 60 MSEK shall be earmarked for the so-called \"Enablers Program\", which includes support for the UN Risk Management Unit, the UN department for Security, and the Resident Coordinator's Office (RCO), which is considered to be crucial for implementation of all development efforts in Somalia. \n\nHowever, the MPTF is not only a financing mechanism but also constitutes a platform for donor coordination in a broader sense since it includes the major actors such as the EU, UK, US, NO, DE, and DK. At the same time, there is a trend that the EU and the UK are launching new bilateral programs in certain areas, while other donors such as DE will expand their support in favor of the MPTF. The MPTF is an important and a key instrument for cooperation between the international community and the Federal Government of Somalia to realize the overall development goals of sustainable peace and development in Somalia.\n\nThe MPTF will harmonize and align the significant resources that are channeled through the UN in Somalia and as such it is foreseen to a more effective international support for Somalia. If the international community, the FSG and other stakeholders cooperate to reduce the risks, it is Sida's assessment that objectives will be reached to a reasonable extent despite the complex context and the many challenges it entails.\n\nThe draft agreement follows that between the UNDP and Sida agreed template for the current form of cooperation. The new standard Standard Administrative Arrangement, SAA will regulate Sweden's contribution to the MPTF. The SAA will be signed by Sida and UNDP as the administrative agent. A Terms of Reference for the MPTF as well as a Memorandum of Understanding between all implementation UN partners are attached. Sida\u2019s conditions in the contribution management rule are thereby fulfilled. Furthermore, a Memorandum of Agreement has been signed between the Government of Somalia and UNDP as an administrative agent.",

        "description": "Somalia is ranked bottom in global indicators on gender inequality, maternal, reproductive and neonatal health and survival. One in 22 women dies every year due to pregnancy or childbirth related complications.  Neonatal deaths in children (i.e. deaths in children during the first 28 days of life) occur at a higher rate in Somalia than in any other country in the world (UNICEF 2016). Fertility in women is high with an average of 6.6 children per woman. At the same time, the incidence of gender-related violence among women including child marriages and forced marriage (more than 45 percent of girls under 18 years and one in 10 girls under 15 have been forced to marriages) and female gender mutilation (about 98 percent) are still high in the country. Women and girls have limited ability, if at all, to decide over their own bodies such when and whom to marry and when and how many children she wants and desires. Family planning still remains a difficult subject to openly discuss. Women seek these services in secrecy. \n\nUNFPA has after engagement by the embassy submitted a request to Sida for continued support to UNFPA:s country program document for the period 2011-2015, which has been formally extended until 31 December 2017. Focus for the CPD is on four key areas: 1) reproductive, maternal and neonatal health; 2) gender equality, with a special attention on SGBV; FGM and early marriage; 3) population data and statistiks; and 4) youh. Sweden has given support to UNFPA since 2014 within the framework of the previous joint health and nutrition program (JHNP) which ended in April 2017. Within the framework of JHNP, UNFPA has contributed to several important results, including: 1) training, quality assurance and registration of midwives; 2) maternal health services for pregnant women including increased access to modern contraception; 3) advocacy and community engagement in preventing female genital mutilation, child marriages, and violence against women; and 4) legal support towards for FGM and SGBV bill, both approved and adopted in Puntland region of Somalia while in federal government and in Somaliland the bills are awaiting parliament approval. UNFPA's work has a clear ownership of the Somali government and its federal administrations.\n\nIn addition to Sweden, UNFPA recieved new funding during 2017 from Finland, UK, Japan and Italy. Swedens longer-term support to UNFPA Somalia operations will be aligned with the new UNFPA Country Program Document (CPD) for the period 2018-2020, which is expected to be endorsed on the September board meeting in New York, and which will be part of the Swedens support to the UN Multi Partner Trust Fund Phase II which will be assessed during late autumn 2017.",

        "title": "UNICEF Enhancing the protection of children in armed conflict",
        "description": "Every year, tens of thousands of boys and girls are recruited and used by armed groups worldwide. This is happening despite international agreements to end the use of children under the age of 18 in armed conflicts. The issue was highlighted further through Sustainable Development Goal 8.7 in Agenda 2030 that among other things calls for immediate and effective measures to eradicate the worst forms of child labour, including the recruitment and use of childsoldiers. Despite these commitments, children are used in armed conflicts and countries are experiencing enormous challenges in convincing fighting parties to release children and find ways to reintegrate them into society. \n\nChildren who are released have often gone through traumatic experiences and are sometimes imprisoned or stigmatized by communities who see them as a continued threat. UNICEF works closely with its partners to avoid that children are separated from their families and has, through advocacy with armed groups since 2016, assisted with the release of 22 500 children out of which 11 300 children have been reintegrated with their communities. Among the activities are psychosocial support, support to continued education and activities that increase social cohesion and peacebuilding. \n\nIn situations of protracted conflicts, there are often gaps in financing when emergency aid through humanitarian assistance often needs to focus on more urgent needs and where development cooperation yet has not been established. Support to the release and reintegration of children formerly associated with armed groups needs extended funding to be sustainable. In order to build resilience against re-recruitment and strengthen young boys\u2019 and girls\u2019 engagement and participation in peacebuilding in support of social cohesion, the gaps that occur between humanitarian and development aid need to be bridged. UNICEF works to bridge this gap through \u2018The New Way of Working\u2019 and has identified the Central African Republic, South Sudan and Somalia as three countries where more than 50% of the children that have been released from armed groups yet are to receive support to socio-economic reintegration programmes. Sida\u2019s support therefore aims at bridging this gap within the three country contexts in order to assist UNICEF in its work to release and reintegrate children in a more sustainable way. \nThe long-term goal of the intervention is \u201cTo contribute to ending and preventing grave violations committed against children in armed conflict, including the recruitment and use of children by armed forces and groups, and to supporting the release and reintegration of these children\u201d.",

A three-year agreement is\nhowever suggested to be signed with the ICRC, where additional contributions will be\nadded to the agreement, subject to funds availability, governmental appropriations and\nSida needs assessments.\nFor 2018, it is proposed that 450 MSEK is allocated to the ICRC for the implementation\nof activities in 36 contexts (of which 8 are regional and covers several countries). Out of\nthe initial allocation 115 MSEK is proposed to be unallocated, which would enable the\nICRC to flexibly add additional financial contributions to countries and regions with\nincreased needs or that are severely underfunded.

        "description": "Reprogrammed funds to mitigate the impact of COVID-19\nThis assessment forms the basis for a new three-year agreement between Oxfam GB and Sida to support Oxfam GB\u2019s humanitarian programme from 1 April 2018 to 31 March 2021, where additional contributions will be added to the agreement, subject to funds availability, governmental appropriations and Sida needs assessments.\n\nIn 2018, more than 135 million people will be in need of humanitarian assistance globally to a cost of 22.5 billion dollar, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). Sweden's humanitarian assistance is needs-based and Sida each year undertakes a humanitarian allocation process in which all humanitarian crises are analysed, and where the partners most relevant to respond to the identified needs are selected.\n\nA number of the identified global needs for 2018 are found in protracted and forgotten crises, and Sida believes that Oxfam GB is well positioned to respond to these needs as the organization is also working with long-term development cooperation. Moreover, Oxfam GB has extensive knowledge of the local context in all proposed projects and capacity building of local actors is central to Oxfam GB's humanitarian work. In 2018-2021, it is therefore suggested that Oxfam GB receives support for emergency lifesaving activities as well as funding for longer-term activities aimed at strengthening societies\u2019 resilience to crises and disasters.\n\nOxfam GB has in previous collaborations with Sida demonstrated that the organisation is a professional and efficient humanitarian actor, most recently in the agreements during 2011-2013 and 2014-2017. In 2016 alone, Oxfam GB managed to reach 1.2 million people with humanitarian support in the sector of WASH, 94,000 people with food security and livelihood interventions and 106,000 people with protection assistance in conflict-affected settings. In line with this, Sida believes that Oxfam GB has an added value when it comes to activities of food security and livelihoods, WASH and protection. Moreover, Sida assesses that Oxfam GB's planned projects are relevant in accordance with Sida\u2019s Humanitarian Crisis Analyses (HCA) that form the basis for the allocation of a majority of the humanitarian funds for 2018 and contribute to the achievement of the goals of the Strategy for Sweden\u2019s humanitarian aid provided through the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) 2017\u20132020. Sida therefore proposes to support Oxfam GB's humanitarian projects to a cost of 104 MSEK.\n\nIn 2018-2021, Oxfam GB plans to reach over 280,000 people in Algeria, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Iraq and Chad. The contribution will consist of four components focusing on emergency life-saving activities; multi-year resilience building projects; the possibility to respond to sudden onset or deteriorating humanitarian emergencies during the year through the Rapid Response Mechanism; as well as support to method development of cash-based programming.\n\nTwo 1-year projects are proposed to be funded with a total of 5 MSEK with the following breakdown:\n\nDemocratic Republic of Congo: 1 MSEK\nIn the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Oxfam will provide support to an INGO forum with 100 NGO members with the aim of increasing the effectiveness of humanitarian interventions through improved coordination.\n\nIraq: 4 MSEK\nIn Iraq, Sida will support a project focusing on first line emergency response. The projects will target 9,600 people and include activities of food distribution as well as distribution of non-food items and hygiene materials.\n\nFive 3-year projects are proposed to be funded with a total of 28 MSEK for 2018, 19 MSEK for 2019 and 16 MSEK for 2019 with the following breakdown:\n\nAlgeria: 15 MSEK (5+5+5 MSEK)\nIn Algeria, 126 600 Sahrawi refugees will be supported in a project focusing on improving dietary diversity and strengthening of small-scale agriculture with the aim of increasing food security in the refugee camps. To reach the planned goals of the project, Oxfam will distribute fresh vegetables and flour, conduct trainings and awareness sessions on agricultural production and introduce drought-resistant crops.\n\nCentral African Republic: 18 MSEK (10+5+3 MSEK)\nIn the Central African Republic, Oxfam will target 17,500 people with food, protection and WASH activities, together with resilience building through recovery of productive assets and strengthening of communities\u2019 conflict management capabilities. The proposed activities include distribution of agricultural kits, awareness-raising on food diversification, protection and gender themes as well as strengthening of community protection committees.\n\nChad: 18 MSEK (10+5+3 MSEK)\nThe project in Chad will target 49,087 people in a project aiming to improve access to basic social services, protection, and the restoration of livelihoods. The project activities include borehole drilling, trainings of water management committees, latrine construction and hygiene promotion. The project will also highlight issues of protection and gender-based violence through awareness raising, establishment of protection committees, mapping of care services for victims of abuses and violations and awareness raising sessions on protection issues.\n\nIraq: 12 MSEK (3+4+5 MSEK)\nIn Iraq, Sida will support a project focusing on capacity building of local humanitarian leadership with the aim of strengthening the local humanitarian response capacity. The projects will target local humanitarian actors as well as a number of local NGOs.\n\nMoreover, it is further proposed that Sida contributes with 25 million within the Rapid Response Mechanism, RRM, to enable Oxfam GB to respond to sudden onset or deteriorating humanitarian emergencies throughout the year.\n\nMoreover, in addition to funding provided directly to Oxfam GB, Sida will also support the Cash Learning Partnership (CaLP) in a 3-year intervention with a total funding of 9 MSEK (4+3+2 MSEK). CaLP is a network based on learning, knowledge sharing, networking and coordination around the appropriate and timely use of cash transfer programming (CTP) in humanitarian response. CaLP does not deliver cash transfer programmes directly. The vision of CaLP is that humanitarian assistance creates the greatest value, choice and dignity for people in crisis. CaLP has six Global Objectives: 1. Ensure sufficient funding is available for cash transfer programming. 2. Ensure cash is systematically considered as an option. 3. Build sufficient capacity for cash transfer programming. 4. Strengthen coordination. 5. Ensure the effectiveness and quality of cash transfer programming. 6. Build evidence and invest in innovation. The work of CaLP\u2019s secretariat is summarised in four strategic objectives: 1. Provide specialist capacity building services and advice. 2. Make the evidence base easily accessible, improve it and apply it through standards and tools. 3. Provide specialist support to coordinating bodies. 4. Ensure influential policy processes promote CTP and the six Global Objectives.\n\nThe support to CaLP is in line with Strategy for Sweden\u2019s humanitarian aid provided through the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) 2017\u20132020 as well as Sida\u2019s commitments to cash in the World Humanitarian Summit (WHS) and in the Grand Bargain. Sida assesses that CaLP is a key organisation to work with to reach the aims of the humanitarian strategy and that the collaboration with CaLP will benefit not only Sida but the humanitarian sector as a whole. As CaLP is not a legal body and is hosted by the Humanitarian Department of Oxfam House, it is decided to include the support to CaLP in this appraisal and in the agreement between Oxfam GB and Sida.\n\nFinally, in addition to the funding of Oxfam GB's humanitarian projects, Oxfam GB will also receive 2 MSEK in programme management costs. This is further elaborated in the budget section in this appraisal.\n\nFor a detailed overview of the project allocations, see Annex VII of the agreement (Budget summary).",

        "description": "Reprogrammed funds to mitigate the impact of COVID-19\nThis intervention builds on current ongoing Sida support to the World Bank Multi-Partner Fund for Somalia (2014-2018), decision number 2014-003041. The current Sida support to the WB-MPF focus on four areas:\n1. Enabling economic growth\n2. Effective and accountable government\n3. Urban infrastructure\n4. Analytical and technical assistance.\n\nIn September 2018, the World Bank Board of Directors approved a new four-year strategy for Somalia 2019-2022. This strategy is the first World Bank strategy for Somalia in 30 years and signals a renewed confidence and trust by the World Bank in Somalia\u00b4s road map to development. This Country Partnership Framework (CPF) is currently funded by 10 donors through the the Multi-Partner Fund modality for delivery. Sweden is the fourth biggest contributor to the fund. The MPF modality is per definition a pooled fund mechanism with is the preferred mechanism of financing in conflict and post-conflict contexts. The MPF is one of three pooled funding mechanisms in Somalia established as part of the Somalia Development and Reconstruction Facility. The MPF is administered by the World Bank and operates in close cooperation with the federal government of Somalia and the contributing donors. WB-MPF are well aligned with government priorities, as articulated in the National Development Plan (2017-2019) and together cover all eight pillars of the NDP. Hence, national ownership and alignment to principles of development effectiveness is adhered to. As Administrator of the Trust Fund, the World Bank is responsible for ensuring that the MPF and its funds are used in accordance with the administrative agreements and that recipients use MPF funds in accordance with the grant agreements.\n\nThe MPF has a specific focus support to core state functions, socioeconomic recovery and sustainable development compared with the UN Fund being more broad in scope and the AfDB focusing on rehabilitation and development of infrastructure. Sida has provided support to UN-MPTF since 2015 (decision number 2015-002435 and 2018-001376). The AFDB-SIF is currently the only funding window which Sida does not contribute. The AFDB-SIF has only started in 2017.\n\nThe overall aim of the CPF 2019-2022 is to lay foundations for the longer-term poverty reduction and inclusive growth by focusing on priority areas and constraints creating the current Somalia \"dual development trap\" created by low level of trusts and exacerbated by widespread vulnerability of repeated shocks. The strategy has two focus areas (1) Strengthening Institutions to Deliver Services and (2) Restoring Economic Resilience and Opportunities. The first focus area will strengthen ongoing governance programs with a new focus on fiscal space and improving access to - and quality of - key social services and resilience. Programs will specifically target public finance management reforms, domestic revenue mobilization and resource sharing, basic delivery systems for social services; and urban resilience. The second focus area aims to increase economic resilience as a basis for long-run poverty reduction and inclusive growth by improving business environment and lowering barriers to market entry, increasing access to finance for inclusion and digital development; and improved access to water and renewable energy. \n\nAlthough the new World Bank strategy covers the period 2019-2022, Sida proposal for support is during 2019-2020, with a total amount of 200 million SEK as well as a support to current MPF programs of 75 million SEK in 2018. Depending if and when the World Bank manage to secure additional IDA financing and if the World Bank manages to re-adjust current plans for the health sector in line with Sida recommendations, Sida will consider contributing additional funds to the MPF during 2021-2022.\n\nTo regulate Sida\u2019s commitment and conditions for supporting the Somalia MPF, Sida and the World Bank will use the 2016 template agreed in December 2016 by Consultative Group on Operational Principles for Trust Funds and Partnership (CGOP) \u201cModel Form of Administration Agreement Model Form \u2013 SDTF/MDTF\u201d. It is important for Sida to use the new administrative agreement since the new template better reflects the Swedish law on disclosure. The new agreement also includes improved language on informing donors on incidences of suspect corruption and reporting which are both priorities to Sida\u2019s line of working. The new administrative agreement template can only apply for new Trust Funds \u2013 or when all donors agree simultaneously to agree to transfer.  Given the significant legal differences between the 2016 template and the previous template currently used for the MPF, Sweden and other donors have exerted pressure to the World Bank to support processes to apply the new 2016 template for new contributions to the Somalia Multi-Partner Trust Fund. In order to accommodate the request by Sweden and other donors who would like to use the 2016 template and exploring different options, the WB has agreed to create a new Multi-Partner Trust Fund, referred to as \u2018MPF Phase 2\u2019. The structure of the MPF Phase 2 means that World Bank will continue to report externally in one consolidated MPF Report but internally there will be two systems across which the World Bank will have to manage the Somalia investment portfolio over a few years. This effectively means an increased administrative cost. Sida has in its decision valued the benefits of using the new agreement template despite the higher administrative the new trust fund entails. The present Trust Fund is valid until 2024 with possible extension of the period. Therefore, Sida finds it difficult to enter into a new multi-year contribution agreement with the current template that does not correspond to Swedish law. Moreover, more MPF donors are expected to gradually shift to the MPF Phase 2, whereby the costs for administration is expected to decline. Other donors have already expressed interest in joining the MPF 2 in the near future. Sweden will also assert its influence among donors and advocate the phasing out of the existing Trust Fund.\n\nThe World Bank will be overall responsible for implementation but the delivery model implies that 80-85% of MPF projects are recipient executed. This means that large shares of the funding to MPF will be channeled through the Federal Government of Somalia and Federal member states. The risk of using country systems in Somalia is considered high. However, the use of country systems maximizes the effectiveness of aid and can help government legitimacy and public support, strengthening the accountability between the State and its citizens. The World Bank does not have an office in Mogadishu yet, but are gradually increasing their presence in Somalia albeit the World Bank\u00b4s presence on the ground is limited, but the World Bank works closely with the Somali authorities, both at national and sub-national level. The World Bank deploys a third-Party Monitoring Agent to support the monitoring of the World Bank\u00b4s projects as well as supporting the Bank teams in understanding the risks and manage the risks. The third-party monitoring agent also provides targeted support to the government in rebuilding and strengthening their Public Financial Management systems.It is Sida\u00b4s assessment that the World Bank as the cooperation partner has routines, resources and competence to ensure adequate internal management and control.  \n\nSomalia is making good progress in core reform areas such as the establishment of the Somalia Financial Management Information System, mechanisms for fiscal transfers between the federal government and federal member states, and improved central bank oversight and supervision. To date, the government has successfully conducted two Staff Monitored Program (SMP I and II) and embarked on a third SMP. Somalia has been identified as eligible for debt relief under the Highly Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) initiative given its unsustainable debt levels. The MPF shows a good track record and results which indicates that there are positive causal links between the MPF programs and the progress that Somalia has made since the establishment of the MPF. \n\nThe WB-MPF portfolio has contributed to crucial reforms such as macroeconomic stability and building a track record for arrears clearance and debt relief. There is evidence that potential access to IFI financing, in the relatively short term, and eventual debt relief in the longer term, are proving powerful incentives for reforms, particularly in public finance management. The MPF private sector development support has been critical for business reforms and engaging the private sector. Developing the Somali private sector is imperative to Somalia\u2019s peace and prosperity, and the government and donors need to work closely with the private sector on economic growth priorities. Nevertheless, the challenges for Somalia are still daunting in many areas such as improving macro-fiscal framework, implementing crucial tax measures to raise revenue, enacting key legislation, forging a political consensus on a federal model and strengthening the capacity of key institutions. \n\nOverall risk level in Somalia:\nViolence and armed conflict as well as political instability are some of the main obstacles to economic and social development in Somalia. Apart from the political and security challenges, Somalia is in a difficult humanitarian situation. Climate change and recurring periods of drought regularly affect the population and its resilience is low after decades of conflict and instability. More concretely, the following general risks that can negatively affects the MPF programs have been identified:\n\u2022\tWorsened security situation and increased Al-Shabaab attacks that can destabilize the country.\n\u2022\tSomalia\u00b4s transition as well as clan/fraction related local conflicts.\n\u2022\tHigh level of corruption and culture of nepotism affecting MPF programs.\n\u2022\tPolitical instability due to the federalization process as well as upcoming elections (both FMS level and federal level).\n\u2022\tRecurrent natural disasters and/or conflict might disrupt the World Bank's MPF long term development interventions where donors might have to re-prioritize or re-program available funds depending on the severity of the shocks.

        "description": "Reprogrammed funds to mitigate the impact of COVID-19\nThis intervention builds on current ongoing Sida support to the World Bank Multi-Partner Fund for Somalia (2014-2018), decision number 2014-003041. The current Sida support to the WB-MPF focus on four areas:\n1. Enabling economic growth\n2. Effective and accountable government\n3. Urban infrastructure\n4. Analytical and technical assistance.\n\nIn September 2018, the World Bank Board of Directors approved a new four-year strategy for Somalia 2019-2022. This strategy is the first World Bank strategy for Somalia in 30 years and signals a renewed confidence and trust by the World Bank in Somalia\u00b4s road map to development. This Country Partnership Framework (CPF) is currently funded by 10 donors through the the Multi-Partner Fund modality for delivery. Sweden is the fourth biggest contributor to the fund. The MPF modality is per definition a pooled fund mechanism with is the preferred mechanism of financing in conflict and post-conflict contexts. The MPF is one of three pooled funding mechanisms in Somalia established as part of the Somalia Development and Reconstruction Facility. The MPF is administered by the World Bank and operates in close cooperation with the federal government of Somalia and the contributing donors. WB-MPF are well aligned with government priorities, as articulated in the National Development Plan (2017-2019) and together cover all eight pillars of the NDP. Hence, national ownership and alignment to principles of development effectiveness is adhered to. As Administrator of the Trust Fund, the World Bank is responsible for ensuring that the MPF and its funds are used in accordance with the administrative agreements and that recipients use MPF funds in accordance with the grant agreements.\n\nThe MPF has a specific focus support to core state functions, socioeconomic recovery and sustainable development compared with the UN Fund being more broad in scope and the AfDB focusing on rehabilitation and development of infrastructure. Sida has provided support to UN-MPTF since 2015 (decision number 2015-002435 and 2018-001376). The AFDB-SIF is currently the only funding window which Sida does not contribute. The AFDB-SIF has only started in 2017.\n\nThe overall aim of the CPF 2019-2022 is to lay foundations for the longer-term poverty reduction and inclusive growth by focusing on priority areas and constraints creating the current Somalia \"dual development trap\" created by low level of trusts and exacerbated by widespread vulnerability of repeated shocks. The strategy has two focus areas (1) Strengthening Institutions to Deliver Services and (2) Restoring Economic Resilience and Opportunities. The first focus area will strengthen ongoing governance programs with a new focus on fiscal space and improving access to - and quality of - key social services and resilience. Programs will specifically target public finance management reforms, domestic revenue mobilization and resource sharing, basic delivery systems for social services; and urban resilience. The second focus area aims to increase economic resilience as a basis for long-run poverty reduction and inclusive growth by improving business environment and lowering barriers to market entry, increasing access to finance for inclusion and digital development; and improved access to water and renewable energy. \n\nAlthough the new World Bank strategy covers the period 2019-2022, Sida proposal for support is during 2019-2020, with a total amount of 200 million SEK as well as a support to current MPF programs of 75 million SEK in 2018. Depending if and when the World Bank manage to secure additional IDA financing and if the World Bank manages to re-adjust current plans for the health sector in line with Sida recommendations, Sida will consider contributing additional funds to the MPF during 2021-2022.\n\nTo regulate Sida\u2019s commitment and conditions for supporting the Somalia MPF, Sida and the World Bank will use the 2016 template agreed in December 2016 by Consultative Group on Operational Principles for Trust Funds and Partnership (CGOP) \u201cModel Form of Administration Agreement Model Form \u2013 SDTF/MDTF\u201d. It is important for Sida to use the new administrative agreement since the new template better reflects the Swedish law on disclosure. The new agreement also includes improved language on informing donors on incidences of suspect corruption and reporting which are both priorities to Sida\u2019s line of working. The new administrative agreement template can only apply for new Trust Funds \u2013 or when all donors agree simultaneously to agree to transfer.  Given the significant legal differences between the 2016 template and the previous template currently used for the MPF, Sweden and other donors have exerted pressure to the World Bank to support processes to apply the new 2016 template for new contributions to the Somalia Multi-Partner Trust Fund.

        "description": "Reprogrammed funds to mitigate the impact of COVID-19\nThis intervention builds on current ongoing Sida support to the World Bank Multi-Partner Fund for Somalia (2014-2018), decision number 2014-003041. The current Sida support to the WB-MPF focus on four areas:\n1. Enabling economic growth\n2. Effective and accountable government\n3. Urban infrastructure\n4. Analytical and technical assistance.\n\nIn September 2018, the World Bank Board of Directors approved a new four-year strategy for Somalia 2019-2022. This strategy is the first World Bank strategy for Somalia in 30 years and signals a renewed confidence and trust by the World Bank in Somalia\u00b4s road map to development. This Country Partnership Framework (CPF) is currently funded by 10 donors through the the Multi-Partner Fund modality for delivery. Sweden is the fourth biggest contributor to the fund. The MPF modality is per definition a pooled fund mechanism with is the preferred mechanism of financing in conflict and post-conflict contexts. The MPF is one of three pooled funding mechanisms in Somalia established as part of the Somalia Development and Reconstruction Facility. The MPF is administered by the World Bank and operates in close cooperation with the federal government of Somalia and the contributing donors. WB-MPF are well aligned with government priorities, as articulated in the National Development Plan (2017-2019) and together cover all eight pillars of the NDP. Hence, national ownership and alignment to principles of development effectiveness is adhered to. As Administrator of the Trust Fund, the World Bank is responsible for ensuring that the MPF and its funds are used in accordance with the administrative agreements and that recipients use MPF funds in accordance with the grant agreements.\n\nThe MPF has a specific focus support to core state functions, socioeconomic recovery and sustainable development compared with the UN Fund being more broad in scope and the AfDB focusing on rehabilitation and development of infrastructure. Sida has provided support to UN-MPTF since 2015 (decision number 2015-002435 and 2018-001376). The AFDB-SIF is currently the only funding window which Sida does not contribute. The AFDB-SIF has only started in 2017.\n\nThe overall aim of the CPF 2019-2022 is to lay foundations for the longer-term poverty reduction and inclusive growth by focusing on priority areas and constraints creating the current Somalia \"dual development trap\" created by low level of trusts and exacerbated by widespread vulnerability of repeated shocks. The strategy has two focus areas (1) Strengthening Institutions to Deliver Services and (2) Restoring Economic Resilience and Opportunities. The first focus area will strengthen ongoing governance programs with a new focus on fiscal space and improving access to - and quality of - key social services and resilience. Programs will specifically target public finance management reforms, domestic revenue mobilization and resource sharing, basic delivery systems for social services; and urban resilience. The second focus area aims to increase economic resilience as a basis for long-run poverty reduction and inclusive growth by improving business environment and lowering barriers to market entry, increasing access to finance for inclusion and digital development; and improved access to water and renewable energy. \n\nAlthough the new World Bank strategy covers the period 2019-2022, Sida proposal for support is during 2019-2020, with a total amount of 200 million SEK as well as a support to current MPF programs of 75 million SEK in 2018. Depending if and when the World Bank manage to secure additional IDA financing and if the World Bank manages to re-adjust current plans for the health sector in line with Sida recommendations, Sida will consider contributing additional funds to the MPF during 2021-2022.\n\nTo regulate Sida\u2019s commitment and conditions for supporting the Somalia MPF, Sida and the World Bank will use the 2016 template agreed in December 2016 by Consultative Group on Operational Principles for Trust Funds and Partnership (CGOP) \u201cModel Form of Administration Agreement Model Form \u2013 SDTF/MDTF\u201d. It is important for Sida to use the new administrative agreement since the new template better reflects the Swedish law on disclosure. The new agreement also includes improved language on informing donors on incidences of suspect corruption and reporting which are both priorities to Sida\u2019s line of working. The new administrative agreement template can only apply for new Trust Funds \u2013 or when all donors agree simultaneously to agree to transfer.  Given the significant legal differences between the 2016 template and the previous template currently used for the MPF, Sweden and other donors have exerted pressure to the World Bank to support processes to apply the new 2016 template for new contributions to the Somalia Multi-Partner Trust Fund. In order to accommodate the request by Sweden and other donors who would like to use the 2016 template and exploring different options, the WB has agreed to create a new Multi-Partner Trust Fund, referred to as \u2018MPF Phase 2\u2019. The structure of the MPF Phase 2 means that World Bank will continue to report externally in one consolidated MPF Report but internally there will be two systems across which the World Bank will have to manage the Somalia investment portfolio over a few years. This effectively means an increased administrative cost. Sida has in its decision valued the benefits of using the new agreement template despite the higher administrative the new trust fund entails. The present Trust Fund is valid until 2024 with possible extension of the period. Therefore, Sida finds it difficult to enter into a new multi-year contribution agreement with the current template that does not correspond to Swedish law. Moreover, more MPF donors are expected to gradually shift to the MPF Phase 2, whereby the costs for administration is expected to decline. Other donors have already expressed interest in joining the MPF 2 in the near future. Sweden will also assert its influence among donors and advocate the phasing out of the existing Trust Fund.\n\nThe World Bank will be overall responsible for implementation but the delivery model implies that 80-85% of MPF projects are recipient executed. This means that large shares of the funding to MPF will be channeled through the Federal Government of Somalia and Federal member states. The risk of using country systems in Somalia is considered high. However, the use of country systems maximizes the effectiveness of aid and can help government legitimacy and public support, strengthening the accountability between the State and its citizens. The World Bank does not have an office in Mogadishu yet, but are gradually increasing their presence in Somalia albeit the World Bank\u00b4s presence on the ground is limited, but the World Bank works closely with the Somali authorities, both at national and sub-national level. The World Bank deploys a third-Party Monitoring Agent to support the monitoring of the World Bank\u00b4s projects as well as supporting the Bank teams in understanding the risks and manage the risks. The third-party monitoring agent also provides targeted support to the government in rebuilding and strengthening their Public Financial Management systems.It is Sida\u00b4s assessment that the World Bank as the cooperation partner has routines, resources and competence to ensure adequate internal management and control.  \n\nSomalia is making good progress in core reform areas such as the establishment of the Somalia Financial Management Information System, mechanisms for fiscal transfers between the federal government and federal member states, and improved central bank oversight and supervision. To date, the government has successfully conducted two Staff Monitored Program (SMP I and II) and embarked on a third SMP. Somalia has been identified as eligible for debt relief under the Highly Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) initiative given its unsustainable debt levels. The MPF shows a good track record and results which indicates that there are positive causal links between the MPF programs and the progress that Somalia has made since the establishment of the MPF. \n\nThe WB-MPF portfolio has contributed to crucial reforms such as macroeconomic stability and building a track record for arrears clearance and debt relief. There is evidence that potential access to IFI financing, in the relatively short term, and eventual debt relief in the longer term, are proving powerful incentives for reforms, particularly in public finance management. The MPF private sector development support has been critical for business reforms and engaging the private sector. Developing the Somali private sector is imperative to Somalia\u2019s peace and prosperity, and the government and donors need to work closely with the private sector on economic growth priorities. Nevertheless, the challenges for Somalia are still daunting in many areas such as improving macro-fiscal framework, implementing crucial tax measures to raise revenue, enacting key legislation, forging a political consensus on a federal model and strengthening the capacity of key institutions. \n\nOverall risk level in Somalia:\nViolence and armed conflict as well as political instability are some of the main obstacles to economic and social development in Somalia. Apart from the political and security challenges, Somalia is in a difficult humanitarian situation. Climate change and recurring periods of drought regularly affect the population and its resilience is low after decades of conflict and instability. More concretely, the following general risks that can negatively affects the MPF programs have been identified:\n\u2022\tWorsened security situation and increased Al-Shabaab attacks that can destabilize the country.\n\u2022\tSomalia\u00b4s transition as well as clan/fraction related local conflicts.\n\u2022\tHigh level of corruption and culture of nepotism affecting MPF programs.\n\u2022\tPolitical instability due to the federalization process as well as upcoming elections (both FMS level and federal level).\n\u2022\tRecurrent natural disasters and/or conflict might disrupt the World Bank's MPF long term development interventions where donors might have to re-prioritize or re-program available funds depending on the severity of the shocks. This might affect donor contributions to the MPF and available funds to MPF, meaning less contributions to the MPF.\n\nThe appraisal memorandum has been written in English, as English-speaking personnel at the Embassy in Nairobi participate in the appraisal and follow-up of the contribution, in accordance with the General Director's decision regarding choice of language as per the instructions from 1 March 2013.",

        "description": "Reprogrammed funds to mitigate the impact of COVID-19\nThis intervention builds on current ongoing Sida support to the World Bank Multi-Partner Fund for Somalia (2014-2018), decision number 2014-003041. The current Sida support to the WB-MPF focus on four areas:\n1. Enabling economic growth\n2. Effective and accountable government\n3. Urban infrastructure\n4. Analytical and technical assistance.\n\nIn September 2018, the World Bank Board of Directors approved a new four-year strategy for Somalia 2019-2022. This strategy is the first World Bank strategy for Somalia in 30 years and signals a renewed confidence and trust by the World Bank in Somalia\u00b4s road map to development. This Country Partnership Framework (CPF) is currently funded by 10 donors through the the Multi-Partner Fund modality for delivery. Sweden is the fourth biggest contributor to the fund. The MPF modality is per definition a pooled fund mechanism with is the preferred mechanism of financing in conflict and post-conflict contexts. The MPF is one of three pooled funding mechanisms in Somalia established as part of the Somalia Development and Reconstruction Facility. The MPF is administered by the World Bank and operates in close cooperation with the federal government of Somalia and the contributing donors. WB-MPF are well aligned with government priorities, as articulated in the National Development Plan (2017-2019) and together cover all eight pillars of the NDP. Hence, national ownership and alignment to principles of development effectiveness is adhered to. As Administrator of the Trust Fund, the World Bank is responsible for ensuring that the MPF and its funds are used in accordance with the administrative agreements and that recipients use MPF funds in accordance with the grant agreements.\n\nThe MPF has a specific focus support to core state functions, socioeconomic recovery and sustainable development compared with the UN Fund being more broad in scope and the AfDB focusing on rehabilitation and development of infrastructure. Sida has provided support to UN-MPTF since 2015 (decision number 2015-002435 and 2018-001376). The AFDB-SIF is currently the only funding window which Sida does not contribute. The AFDB-SIF has only started in 2017.\n\nThe overall aim of the CPF 2019-2022 is to lay foundations for the longer-term poverty reduction and inclusive growth by focusing on priority areas and constraints creating the current Somalia \"dual development trap\" created by low level of trusts and exacerbated by widespread vulnerability of repeated shocks. The strategy has two focus areas (1) Strengthening Institutions to Deliver Services and (2) Restoring Economic Resilience and Opportunities. The first focus area will strengthen ongoing governance programs with a new focus on fiscal space and improving access to - and quality of - key social services and resilience. Programs will specifically target public finance management reforms, domestic revenue mobilization and resource sharing, basic delivery systems for social services; and urban resilience. The second focus area aims to increase economic resilience as a basis for long-run poverty reduction and inclusive growth by improving business environment and lowering barriers to market entry, increasing access to finance for inclusion and digital development; and improved access to water and renewable energy. \n\nAlthough the new World Bank strategy covers the period 2019-2022, Sida proposal for support is during 2019-2020, with a total amount of 200 million SEK as well as a support to current MPF programs of 75 million SEK in 2018. Depending if and when the World Bank manage to secure additional IDA financing and if the World Bank manages to re-adjust current plans for the health sector in line with Sida recommendations, Sida will consider contributing additional funds to the MPF during 2021-2022.\n\nTo regulate Sida\u2019s commitment and conditions for supporting the Somalia MPF, Sida and the World Bank will use the 2016 template agreed in December 2016 by Consultative Group on Operational Principles for Trust Funds and Partnership (CGOP) \u201cModel Form of Administration Agreement Model Form \u2013 SDTF/MDTF\u201d. It is important for Sida to use the new administrative agreement since the new template better reflects the Swedish law on disclosure. The new agreement also includes improved language on informing donors on incidences of suspect corruption and reporting which are both priorities to Sida\u2019s line of working. The new administrative agreement template can only apply for new Trust Funds \u2013 or when all donors agree simultaneously to agree to transfer.  Given the significant legal differences between the 2016 template and the previous template currently used for the MPF, Sweden and other donors have exerted pressure to the World Bank to support processes to apply the new 2016 template for new contributions to the Somalia Multi-Partner Trust Fund. In order to accommodate the request by Sweden and other donors who would like to use the 2016 template and exploring different options, the WB has agreed to create a new Multi-Partner Trust Fund, referred to as \u2018MPF Phase 2\u2019. The structure of the MPF Phase 2 means that World Bank will continue to report externally in one consolidated MPF Report but internally there will be two systems across which the World Bank will have to manage the Somalia investment portfolio over a few years. This effectively means an increased administrative cost. Sida has in its decision valued the benefits of using the new agreement template despite the higher administrative the new trust fund entails. The present Trust Fund is valid until 2024 with possible extension of the period. Therefore, Sida finds it difficult to enter into a new multi-year contribution agreement with the current template that does not correspond to Swedish law. Moreover, more MPF donors are expected to gradually shift to the MPF Phase 2, whereby the costs for administration is expected to decline. Other donors have already expressed interest in joining the MPF 2 in the near future. Sweden will also assert its influence among donors and advocate the phasing out of the existing Trust Fund.\n\nThe World Bank will be overall responsible for implementation but the delivery model implies that 80-85% of MPF projects are recipient executed. This means that large shares of the funding to MPF will be channeled through the Federal Government of Somalia and Federal member states. The risk of using country systems in Somalia is considered high. However, the use of country systems maximizes the effectiveness of aid and can help government legitimacy and public support, strengthening the accountability between the State and its citizens. The World Bank does not have an office in Mogadishu yet, but are gradually increasing their presence in Somalia albeit the World Bank\u00b4s presence on the ground is limited, but the World Bank works closely with the Somali authorities, both at national and sub-national level. The World Bank deploys a third-Party Monitoring Agent to support the monitoring of the World Bank\u00b4s projects as well as supporting the Bank teams in understanding the risks and manage the risks. The third-party monitoring agent also provides targeted support to the government in rebuilding and strengthening their Public Financial Management systems.It is Sida\u00b4s assessment that the World Bank as the cooperation partner has routines, resources and competence to ensure adequate internal management and control.  \n\nSomalia is making good progress in core reform areas such as the establishment of the Somalia Financial Management Information System, mechanisms for fiscal transfers between the federal government and federal member states, and improved central bank oversight and supervision. To date, the government has successfully conducted two Staff Monitored Program (SMP I and II) and embarked on a third SMP. Somalia has been identified as eligible for debt relief under the Highly Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) initiative given its unsustainable debt levels. The MPF shows a good track record and results which indicates that there are positive causal links between the MPF programs and the progress that Somalia has made since the establishment of the MPF. \n\nThe WB-MPF portfolio has contributed to crucial reforms such as macroeconomic stability and building a track record for arrears clearance and debt relief. There is evidence that potential access to IFI financing, in the relatively short term, and eventual debt relief in the longer term, are proving powerful incentives for reforms, particularly in public finance management. The MPF private sector development support has been critical for business reforms and engaging the private sector. Developing the Somali private sector is imperative to Somalia\u2019s peace and prosperity, and the government and donors need to work closely with the private sector on economic growth priorities.

The second focus area aims to increase economic resilience as a basis for long-run poverty reduction and inclusive growth by improving business environment and lowering barriers to market entry, increasing access to finance for inclusion and digital development; and improved access to water and renewable energy. \n\nAlthough the new World Bank strategy covers the period 2019-2022, Sida proposal for support is during 2019-2020, with a total amount of 200 million SEK as well as a support to current MPF programs of 75 million SEK in 2018. Depending if and when the World Bank manage to secure additional IDA financing and if the World Bank manages to re-adjust current plans for the health sector in line with Sida recommendations, Sida will consider contributing additional funds to the MPF during 2021-2022.\n\nTo regulate Sida\u2019s commitment and conditions for supporting the Somalia MPF, Sida and the World Bank will use the 2016 template agreed in December 2016 by Consultative Group on Operational Principles for Trust Funds and Partnership (CGOP) \u201cModel Form of Administration Agreement Model Form \u2013 SDTF/MDTF\u201d. It is important for Sida to use the new administrative agreement since the new template better reflects the Swedish law on disclosure. The new agreement also includes improved language on informing donors on incidences of suspect corruption and reporting which are both priorities to Sida\u2019s line of working. The new administrative agreement template can only apply for new Trust Funds \u2013 or when all donors agree simultaneously to agree to transfer.  Given the significant legal differences between the 2016 template and the previous template currently used for the MPF, Sweden and other donors have exerted pressure to the World Bank to support processes to apply the new 2016 template for new contributions to the Somalia Multi-Partner Trust Fund. In order to accommodate the request by Sweden and other donors who would like to use the 2016 template and exploring different options, the WB has agreed to create a new Multi-Partner Trust Fund, referred to as \u2018MPF Phase 2\u2019. The structure of the MPF Phase 2 means that World Bank will continue to report externally in one consolidated MPF Report but internally there will be two systems across which the World Bank will have to manage the Somalia investment portfolio over a few years. This effectively means an increased administrative cost. Sida has in its decision valued the benefits of using the new agreement template despite the higher administrative the new trust fund entails. The present Trust Fund is valid until 2024 with possible extension of the period. Therefore, Sida finds it difficult to enter into a new multi-year contribution agreement with the current template that does not correspond to Swedish law. Moreover, more MPF donors are expected to gradually shift to the MPF Phase 2, whereby the costs for administration is expected to decline. Other donors have already expressed interest in joining the MPF 2 in the near future. Sweden will also assert its influence among donors and advocate the phasing out of the existing Trust Fund.\n\nThe World Bank will be overall responsible for implementation but the delivery model implies that 80-85% of MPF projects are recipient executed. This means that large shares of the funding to MPF will be channeled through the Federal Government of Somalia and Federal member states. The risk of using country systems in Somalia is considered high. However, the use of country systems maximizes the effectiveness of aid and can help government legitimacy and public support, strengthening the accountability between the State and its citizens. The World Bank does not have an office in Mogadishu yet, but are gradually increasing their presence in Somalia albeit the World Bank\u00b4s presence on the ground is limited, but the World Bank works closely with the Somali authorities, both at national and sub-national level. The World Bank deploys a third-Party Monitoring Agent to support the monitoring of the World Bank\u00b4s projects as well as supporting the Bank teams in understanding the risks and manage the risks. The third-party monitoring agent also provides targeted support to the government in rebuilding and strengthening their Public Financial Management systems.It is Sida\u00b4s assessment that the World Bank as the cooperation partner has routines, resources and competence to ensure adequate internal management and control.  \n\nSomalia is making good progress in core reform areas such as the establishment of the Somalia Financial Management Information System, mechanisms for fiscal transfers between the federal government and federal member states, and improved central bank oversight and supervision. To date, the government has successfully conducted two Staff Monitored Program (SMP I and II) and embarked on a third SMP. Somalia has been identified as eligible for debt relief under the Highly Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) initiative given its unsustainable debt levels. The MPF shows a good track record and results which indicates that there are positive causal links between the MPF programs and the progress that Somalia has made since the establishment of the MPF. \n\nThe WB-MPF portfolio has contributed to crucial reforms such as macroeconomic stability and building a track record for arrears clearance and debt relief. There is evidence that potential access to IFI financing, in the relatively short term, and eventual debt relief in the longer term, are proving powerful incentives for reforms, particularly in public finance management. The MPF private sector development support has been critical for business reforms and engaging the private sector. Developing the Somali private sector is imperative to Somalia\u2019s peace and prosperity, and the government and donors need to work closely with the private sector on economic growth priorities. Nevertheless, the challenges for Somalia are still daunting in many areas such as improving macro-fiscal framework, implementing crucial tax measures to raise revenue, enacting key legislation, forging a political consensus on a federal model and strengthening the capacity of key institutions. \n\nOverall risk level in Somalia:\nViolence and armed conflict as well as political instability are some of the main obstacles to economic and social development in Somalia. Apart from the political and security challenges, Somalia is in a difficult humanitarian situation. Climate change and recurring periods of drought regularly affect the population and its resilience is low after decades of conflict and instability. More concretely, the following general risks that can negatively affects the MPF programs have been identified:\n\u2022\tWorsened security situation and increased Al-Shabaab attacks that can destabilize the country.\n\u2022\tSomalia\u00b4s transition as well as clan/fraction related local conflicts.\n\u2022\tHigh level of corruption and culture of nepotism affecting MPF programs.\n\u2022\tPolitical instability due to the federalization process as well as upcoming elections (both FMS level and federal level).\n\u2022\tRecurrent natural disasters and/or conflict might disrupt the World Bank's MPF long term development interventions where donors might have to re-prioritize or re-program available funds depending on the severity of the shocks. This might affect donor contributions to the MPF and available funds to MPF, meaning less contributions to the MPF.\n\nThe appraisal memorandum has been written in English, as English-speaking personnel at the Embassy in Nairobi participate in the appraisal and follow-up of the contribution, in accordance with the General Director's decision regarding choice of language as per the instructions from 1 March 2013.",

        "description": "Reprogrammed funds to mitigate the impact of COVID-19\nThis intervention builds on current ongoing Sida support to the World Bank Multi-Partner Fund for Somalia (2014-2018), decision number 2014-003041. The current Sida support to the WB-MPF focus on four areas:\n1. Enabling economic growth\n2. Effective and accountable government\n3. Urban infrastructure\n4. Analytical and technical assistance.\n\nIn September 2018, the World Bank Board of Directors approved a new four-year strategy for Somalia 2019-2022. This strategy is the first World Bank strategy for Somalia in 30 years and signals a renewed confidence and trust by the World Bank in Somalia\u00b4s road map to development. This Country Partnership Framework (CPF) is currently funded by 10 donors through the the Multi-Partner Fund modality for delivery. Sweden is the fourth biggest contributor to the fund. The MPF modality is per definition a pooled fund mechanism with is the preferred mechanism of financing in conflict and post-conflict contexts. The MPF is one of three pooled funding mechanisms in Somalia established as part of the Somalia Development and Reconstruction Facility. The MPF is administered by the World Bank and operates in close cooperation with the federal government of Somalia and the contributing donors. WB-MPF are well aligned with government priorities, as articulated in the National Development Plan (2017-2019) and together cover all eight pillars of the NDP. Hence, national ownership and alignment to principles of development effectiveness is adhered to. As Administrator of the Trust Fund, the World Bank is responsible for ensuring that the MPF and its funds are used in accordance with the administrative agreements and that recipients use MPF funds in accordance with the grant agreements.\n\nThe MPF has a specific focus support to core state functions, socioeconomic recovery and sustainable development compared with the UN Fund being more broad in scope and the AfDB focusing on rehabilitation and development of infrastructure. Sida has provided support to UN-MPTF since 2015 (decision number 2015-002435 and 2018-001376). The AFDB-SIF is currently the only funding window which Sida does not contribute. The AFDB-SIF has only started in 2017.\n\nThe overall aim of the CPF 2019-2022 is to lay foundations for the longer-term poverty reduction and inclusive growth by focusing on priority areas and constraints creating the current Somalia \"dual development trap\" created by low level of trusts and exacerbated by widespread vulnerability of repeated shocks. The strategy has two focus areas (1) Strengthening Institutions to Deliver Services and (2) Restoring Economic Resilience and Opportunities. The first focus area will strengthen ongoing governance programs with a new focus on fiscal space and improving access to - and quality of - key social services and resilience. Programs will specifically target public finance management reforms, domestic revenue mobilization and resource sharing, basic delivery systems for social services; and urban resilience.

        "description": "Reprogrammed funds to mitigate the impact of COVID-19\nThis intervention builds on current ongoing Sida support to the World Bank Multi-Partner Fund for Somalia (2014-2018), decision number 2014-003041. The current Sida support to the WB-MPF focus on four areas:\n1. Enabling economic growth\n2. Effective and accountable government\n3. Urban infrastructure\n4. Analytical and technical assistance.\n\nIn September 2018, the World Bank Board of Directors approved a new four-year strategy for Somalia 2019-2022. This strategy is the first World Bank strategy for Somalia in 30 years and signals a renewed confidence and trust by the World Bank in Somalia\u00b4s road map to development. This Country Partnership Framework (CPF) is currently funded by 10 donors through the the Multi-Partner Fund modality for delivery. Sweden is the fourth biggest contributor to the fund. The MPF modality is per definition a pooled fund mechanism with is the preferred mechanism of financing in conflict and post-conflict contexts. The MPF is one of three pooled funding mechanisms in Somalia established as part of the Somalia Development and Reconstruction Facility. The MPF is administered by the World Bank and operates in close cooperation with the federal government of Somalia and the contributing donors. WB-MPF are well aligned with government priorities, as articulated in the National Development Plan (2017-2019) and together cover all eight pillars of the NDP. Hence, national ownership and alignment to principles of development effectiveness is adhered to. As Administrator of the Trust Fund, the World Bank is responsible for ensuring that the MPF and its funds are used in accordance with the administrative agreements and that recipients use MPF funds in accordance with the grant agreements.\n\nThe MPF has a specific focus support to core state functions, socioeconomic recovery and sustainable development compared with the UN Fund being more broad in scope and the AfDB focusing on rehabilitation and development of infrastructure. Sida has provided support to UN-MPTF since 2015 (decision number 2015-002435 and 2018-001376). The AFDB-SIF is currently the only funding window which Sida does not contribute. The AFDB-SIF has only started in 2017.\n\nThe overall aim of the CPF 2019-2022 is to lay foundations for the longer-term poverty reduction and inclusive growth by focusing on priority areas and constraints creating the current Somalia \"dual development trap\" created by low level of trusts and exacerbated by widespread vulnerability of repeated shocks. The strategy has two focus areas (1) Strengthening Institutions to Deliver Services and (2) Restoring Economic Resilience and Opportunities. The first focus area will strengthen ongoing governance programs with a new focus on fiscal space and improving access to - and quality of - key social services and resilience. Programs will specifically target public finance management reforms, domestic revenue mobilization and resource sharing, basic delivery systems for social services; and urban resilience. The second focus area aims to increase economic resilience as a basis for long-run poverty reduction and inclusive growth by improving business environment and lowering barriers to market entry, increasing access to finance for inclusion and digital development; and improved access to water and renewable energy. \n\nAlthough the new World Bank strategy covers the period 2019-2022, Sida proposal for support is during 2019-2020, with a total amount of 200 million SEK as well as a support to current MPF programs of 75 million SEK in 2018. Depending if and when the World Bank manage to secure additional IDA financing and if the World Bank manages to re-adjust current plans for the health sector in line with Sida recommendations, Sida will consider contributing additional funds to the MPF during 2021-2022.\n\nTo regulate Sida\u2019s commitment and conditions for supporting the Somalia MPF, Sida and the World Bank will use the 2016 template agreed in December 2016 by Consultative Group on Operational Principles for Trust Funds and Partnership (CGOP) \u201cModel Form of Administration Agreement Model Form \u2013 SDTF/MDTF\u201d. It is important for Sida to use the new administrative agreement since the new template better reflects the Swedish law on disclosure. The new agreement also includes improved language on informing donors on incidences of suspect corruption and reporting which are both priorities to Sida\u2019s line of working. The new administrative agreement template can only apply for new Trust Funds \u2013 or when all donors agree simultaneously to agree to transfer.  Given the significant legal differences between the 2016 template and the previous template currently used for the MPF, Sweden and other donors have exerted pressure to the World Bank to support processes to apply the new 2016 template for new contributions to the Somalia Multi-Partner Trust Fund. In order to accommodate the request by Sweden and other donors who would like to use the 2016 template and exploring different options, the WB has agreed to create a new Multi-Partner Trust Fund, referred to as \u2018MPF Phase 2\u2019. The structure of the MPF Phase 2 means that World Bank will continue to report externally in one consolidated MPF Report but internally there will be two systems across which the World Bank will have to manage the Somalia investment portfolio over a few years. This effectively means an increased administrative cost. Sida has in its decision valued the benefits of using the new agreement template despite the higher administrative the new trust fund entails. The present Trust Fund is valid until 2024 with possible extension of the period. Therefore, Sida finds it difficult to enter into a new multi-year contribution agreement with the current template that does not correspond to Swedish law. Moreover, more MPF donors are expected to gradually shift to the MPF Phase 2, whereby the costs for administration is expected to decline. Other donors have already expressed interest in joining the MPF 2 in the near future. Sweden will also assert its influence among donors and advocate the phasing out of the existing Trust Fund.\n\nThe World Bank will be overall responsible for implementation but the delivery model implies that 80-85% of MPF projects are recipient executed. This means that large shares of the funding to MPF will be channeled through the Federal Government of Somalia and Federal member states. The risk of using country systems in Somalia is considered high. However, the use of country systems maximizes the effectiveness of aid and can help government legitimacy and public support, strengthening the accountability between the State and its citizens. The World Bank does not have an office in Mogadishu yet, but are gradually increasing their presence in Somalia albeit the World Bank\u00b4s presence on the ground is limited, but the World Bank works closely with the Somali authorities, both at national and sub-national level. The World Bank deploys a third-Party Monitoring Agent to support the monitoring of the World Bank\u00b4s projects as well as supporting the Bank teams in understanding the risks and manage the risks. The third-party monitoring agent also provides targeted support to the government in rebuilding and strengthening their Public Financial Management systems.It is Sida\u00b4s assessment that the World Bank as the cooperation partner has routines, resources and competence to ensure adequate internal management and control.  \n\nSomalia is making good progress in core reform areas such as the establishment of the Somalia Financial Management Information System, mechanisms for fiscal transfers between the federal government and federal member states, and improved central bank oversight and supervision. To date, the government has successfully conducted two Staff Monitored Program (SMP I and II) and embarked on a third SMP. Somalia has been identified as eligible for debt relief under the Highly Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) initiative given its unsustainable debt levels. The MPF shows a good track record and results which indicates that there are positive causal links between the MPF programs and the progress that Somalia has made since the establishment of the MPF. \n\nThe WB-MPF portfolio has contributed to crucial reforms such as macroeconomic stability and building a track record for arrears clearance and debt relief. There is evidence that potential access to IFI financing, in the relatively short term, and eventual debt relief in the longer term, are proving powerful incentives for reforms, particularly in public finance management. The MPF private sector development support has been critical for business reforms and engaging the private sector. Developing the Somali private sector is imperative to Somalia\u2019s peace and prosperity, and the government and donors need to work closely with the private sector on economic growth priorities. Nevertheless, the challenges for Somalia are still daunting in many areas such as improving macro-fiscal framework, implementing crucial tax measures to raise revenue, enacting key legislation, forging a political consensus on a federal model and strengthening the capacity of key institutions. \n\nOverall risk level in Somalia:\nViolence and armed conflict as well as political instability are some of the main obstacles to economic and social development in Somalia. Apart from the political and security challenges, Somalia is in a difficult humanitarian situation. Climate change and recurring periods of drought regularly affect the population and its resilience is low after decades of conflict and instability. More concretely, the following general risks that can negatively affects the MPF programs have been identified:\n\u2022\tWorsened security situation and increased Al-Shabaab attacks that can destabilize the country.\n\u2022\tSomalia\u00b4s transition as well as clan/fraction related local conflicts.\n\u2022\tHigh level of corruption and culture of nepotism affecting MPF programs.\n\u2022\tPolitical instability due to the federalization process as well as upcoming elections (both FMS level and federal level).\n\u2022\tRecurrent natural disasters and/or conflict might disrupt the World Bank's MPF long term development interventions where donors might have to re-prioritize or re-program available funds depending on the severity of the shocks. This might affect donor contributions to the MPF and available funds to MPF, meaning less contributions to the MPF.\n\nThe appraisal memorandum has been written in English, as English-speaking personnel at the Embassy in Nairobi participate in the appraisal and follow-up of the contribution, in accordance with the General Director's decision regarding choice of language as per the instructions from 1 March 2013.",

The World Bank does not have an office in Mogadishu yet, but are gradually increasing their presence in Somalia albeit the World Bank\u00b4s presence on the ground is limited, but the World Bank works closely with the Somali authorities, both at national and sub-national level. The World Bank deploys a third-Party Monitoring Agent to support the monitoring of the World Bank\u00b4s projects as well as supporting the Bank teams in understanding the risks and manage the risks. The third-party monitoring agent also provides targeted support to the government in rebuilding and strengthening their Public Financial Management systems.It is Sida\u00b4s assessment that the World Bank as the cooperation partner has routines, resources and competence to ensure adequate internal management and control.  \n\nSomalia is making good progress in core reform areas such as the establishment of the Somalia Financial Management Information System, mechanisms for fiscal transfers between the federal government and federal member states, and improved central bank oversight and supervision. To date, the government has successfully conducted two Staff Monitored Program (SMP I and II) and embarked on a third SMP. Somalia has been identified as eligible for debt relief under the Highly Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) initiative given its unsustainable debt levels. The MPF shows a good track record and results which indicates that there are positive causal links between the MPF programs and the progress that Somalia has made since the establishment of the MPF. \n\nThe WB-MPF portfolio has contributed to crucial reforms such as macroeconomic stability and building a track record for arrears clearance and debt relief. There is evidence that potential access to IFI financing, in the relatively short term, and eventual debt relief in the longer term, are proving powerful incentives for reforms, particularly in public finance management. The MPF private sector development support has been critical for business reforms and engaging the private sector. Developing the Somali private sector is imperative to Somalia\u2019s peace and prosperity, and the government and donors need to work closely with the private sector on economic growth priorities. Nevertheless, the challenges for Somalia are still daunting in many areas such as improving macro-fiscal framework, implementing crucial tax measures to raise revenue, enacting key legislation, forging a political consensus on a federal model and strengthening the capacity of key institutions. \n\nOverall risk level in Somalia:\nViolence and armed conflict as well as political instability are some of the main obstacles to economic and social development in Somalia. Apart from the political and security challenges, Somalia is in a difficult humanitarian situation.

        "description": "Reprogrammed funds to mitigate the impact of COVID-19\nThis intervention builds on current ongoing Sida support to the World Bank Multi-Partner Fund for Somalia (2014-2018), decision number 2014-003041. The current Sida support to the WB-MPF focus on four areas:\n1. Enabling economic growth\n2. Effective and accountable government\n3. Urban infrastructure\n4. Analytical and technical assistance.\n\nIn September 2018, the World Bank Board of Directors approved a new four-year strategy for Somalia 2019-2022. This strategy is the first World Bank strategy for Somalia in 30 years and signals a renewed confidence and trust by the World Bank in Somalia\u00b4s road map to development. This Country Partnership Framework (CPF) is currently funded by 10 donors through the the Multi-Partner Fund modality for delivery. Sweden is the fourth biggest contributor to the fund. The MPF modality is per definition a pooled fund mechanism with is the preferred mechanism of financing in conflict and post-conflict contexts. The MPF is one of three pooled funding mechanisms in Somalia established as part of the Somalia Development and Reconstruction Facility. The MPF is administered by the World Bank and operates in close cooperation with the federal government of Somalia and the contributing donors. WB-MPF are well aligned with government priorities, as articulated in the National Development Plan (2017-2019) and together cover all eight pillars of the NDP. Hence, national ownership and alignment to principles of development effectiveness is adhered to. As Administrator of the Trust Fund, the World Bank is responsible for ensuring that the MPF and its funds are used in accordance with the administrative agreements and that recipients use MPF funds in accordance with the grant agreements.\n\nThe MPF has a specific focus support to core state functions, socioeconomic recovery and sustainable development compared with the UN Fund being more broad in scope and the AfDB focusing on rehabilitation and development of infrastructure. Sida has provided support to UN-MPTF since 2015 (decision number 2015-002435 and 2018-001376). The AFDB-SIF is currently the only funding window which Sida does not contribute. The AFDB-SIF has only started in 2017.\n\nThe overall aim of the CPF 2019-2022 is to lay foundations for the longer-term poverty reduction and inclusive growth by focusing on priority areas and constraints creating the current Somalia \"dual development trap\" created by low level of trusts and exacerbated by widespread vulnerability of repeated shocks. The strategy has two focus areas (1) Strengthening Institutions to Deliver Services and (2) Restoring Economic Resilience and Opportunities. The first focus area will strengthen ongoing governance programs with a new focus on fiscal space and improving access to - and quality of - key social services and resilience. Programs will specifically target public finance management reforms, domestic revenue mobilization and resource sharing, basic delivery systems for social services; and urban resilience. The second focus area aims to increase economic resilience as a basis for long-run poverty reduction and inclusive growth by improving business environment and lowering barriers to market entry, increasing access to finance for inclusion and digital development; and improved access to water and renewable energy. \n\nAlthough the new World Bank strategy covers the period 2019-2022, Sida proposal for support is during 2019-2020, with a total amount of 200 million SEK as well as a support to current MPF programs of 75 million SEK in 2018. Depending if and when the World Bank manage to secure additional IDA financing and if the World Bank manages to re-adjust current plans for the health sector in line with Sida recommendations, Sida will consider contributing additional funds to the MPF during 2021-2022.\n\nTo regulate Sida\u2019s commitment and conditions for supporting the Somalia MPF, Sida and the World Bank will use the 2016 template agreed in December 2016 by Consultative Group on Operational Principles for Trust Funds and Partnership (CGOP) \u201cModel Form of Administration Agreement Model Form \u2013 SDTF/MDTF\u201d. It is important for Sida to use the new administrative agreement since the new template better reflects the Swedish law on disclosure. The new agreement also includes improved language on informing donors on incidences of suspect corruption and reporting which are both priorities to Sida\u2019s line of working. The new administrative agreement template can only apply for new Trust Funds \u2013 or when all donors agree simultaneously to agree to transfer.  Given the significant legal differences between the 2016 template and the previous template currently used for the MPF, Sweden and other donors have exerted pressure to the World Bank to support processes to apply the new 2016 template for new contributions to the Somalia Multi-Partner Trust Fund. In order to accommodate the request by Sweden and other donors who would like to use the 2016 template and exploring different options, the WB has agreed to create a new Multi-Partner Trust Fund, referred to as \u2018MPF Phase 2\u2019. The structure of the MPF Phase 2 means that World Bank will continue to report externally in one consolidated MPF Report but internally there will be two systems across which the World Bank will have to manage the Somalia investment portfolio over a few years. This effectively means an increased administrative cost. Sida has in its decision valued the benefits of using the new agreement template despite the higher administrative the new trust fund entails. The present Trust Fund is valid until 2024 with possible extension of the period. Therefore, Sida finds it difficult to enter into a new multi-year contribution agreement with the current template that does not correspond to Swedish law. Moreover, more MPF donors are expected to gradually shift to the MPF Phase 2, whereby the costs for administration is expected to decline. Other donors have already expressed interest in joining the MPF 2 in the near future. Sweden will also assert its influence among donors and advocate the phasing out of the existing Trust Fund.\n\nThe World Bank will be overall responsible for implementation but the delivery model implies that 80-85% of MPF projects are recipient executed. This means that large shares of the funding to MPF will be channeled through the Federal Government of Somalia and Federal member states. The risk of using country systems in Somalia is considered high. However, the use of country systems maximizes the effectiveness of aid and can help government legitimacy and public support, strengthening the accountability between the State and its citizens. The World Bank does not have an office in Mogadishu yet, but are gradually increasing their presence in Somalia albeit the World Bank\u00b4s presence on the ground is limited, but the World Bank works closely with the Somali authorities, both at national and sub-national level.

As Administrator of the Trust Fund, the World Bank is responsible for ensuring that the MPF and its funds are used in accordance with the administrative agreements and that recipients use MPF funds in accordance with the grant agreements.\n\nThe MPF has a specific focus support to core state functions, socioeconomic recovery and sustainable development compared with the UN Fund being more broad in scope and the AfDB focusing on rehabilitation and development of infrastructure. Sida has provided support to UN-MPTF since 2015 (decision number 2015-002435 and 2018-001376). The AFDB-SIF is currently the only funding window which Sida does not contribute. The AFDB-SIF has only started in 2017.\n\nThe overall aim of the CPF 2019-2022 is to lay foundations for the longer-term poverty reduction and inclusive growth by focusing on priority areas and constraints creating the current Somalia \"dual development trap\" created by low level of trusts and exacerbated by widespread vulnerability of repeated shocks. The strategy has two focus areas (1) Strengthening Institutions to Deliver Services and (2) Restoring Economic Resilience and Opportunities. The first focus area will strengthen ongoing governance programs with a new focus on fiscal space and improving access to - and quality of - key social services and resilience. Programs will specifically target public finance management reforms, domestic revenue mobilization and resource sharing, basic delivery systems for social services; and urban resilience. The second focus area aims to increase economic resilience as a basis for long-run poverty reduction and inclusive growth by improving business environment and lowering barriers to market entry, increasing access to finance for inclusion and digital development; and improved access to water and renewable energy. \n\nAlthough the new World Bank strategy covers the period 2019-2022, Sida proposal for support is during 2019-2020, with a total amount of 200 million SEK as well as a support to current MPF programs of 75 million SEK in 2018. Depending if and when the World Bank manage to secure additional IDA financing and if the World Bank manages to re-adjust current plans for the health sector in line with Sida recommendations, Sida will consider contributing additional funds to the MPF during 2021-2022.\n\nTo regulate Sida\u2019s commitment and conditions for supporting the Somalia MPF, Sida and the World Bank will use the 2016 template agreed in December 2016 by Consultative Group on Operational Principles for Trust Funds and Partnership (CGOP) \u201cModel Form of Administration Agreement Model Form \u2013 SDTF/MDTF\u201d. It is important for Sida to use the new administrative agreement since the new template better reflects the Swedish law on disclosure. The new agreement also includes improved language on informing donors on incidences of suspect corruption and reporting which are both priorities to Sida\u2019s line of working. The new administrative agreement template can only apply for new Trust Funds \u2013 or when all donors agree simultaneously to agree to transfer.  Given the significant legal differences between the 2016 template and the previous template currently used for the MPF, Sweden and other donors have exerted pressure to the World Bank to support processes to apply the new 2016 template for new contributions to the Somalia Multi-Partner Trust Fund. In order to accommodate the request by Sweden and other donors who would like to use the 2016 template and exploring different options, the WB has agreed to create a new Multi-Partner Trust Fund, referred to as \u2018MPF Phase 2\u2019. The structure of the MPF Phase 2 means that World Bank will continue to report externally in one consolidated MPF Report but internally there will be two systems across which the World Bank will have to manage the Somalia investment portfolio over a few years. This effectively means an increased administrative cost. Sida has in its decision valued the benefits of using the new agreement template despite the higher administrative the new trust fund entails. The present Trust Fund is valid until 2024 with possible extension of the period. Therefore, Sida finds it difficult to enter into a new multi-year contribution agreement with the current template that does not correspond to Swedish law. Moreover, more MPF donors are expected to gradually shift to the MPF Phase 2, whereby the costs for administration is expected to decline. Other donors have already expressed interest in joining the MPF 2 in the near future. Sweden will also assert its influence among donors and advocate the phasing out of the existing Trust Fund.\n\nThe World Bank will be overall responsible for implementation but the delivery model implies that 80-85% of MPF projects are recipient executed. This means that large shares of the funding to MPF will be channeled through the Federal Government of Somalia and Federal member states. The risk of using country systems in Somalia is considered high. However, the use of country systems maximizes the effectiveness of aid and can help government legitimacy and public support, strengthening the accountability between the State and its citizens. The World Bank does not have an office in Mogadishu yet, but are gradually increasing their presence in Somalia albeit the World Bank\u00b4s presence on the ground is limited, but the World Bank works closely with the Somali authorities, both at national and sub-national level. The World Bank deploys a third-Party Monitoring Agent to support the monitoring of the World Bank\u00b4s projects as well as supporting the Bank teams in understanding the risks and manage the risks. The third-party monitoring agent also provides targeted support to the government in rebuilding and strengthening their Public Financial Management systems.It is Sida\u00b4s assessment that the World Bank as the cooperation partner has routines, resources and competence to ensure adequate internal management and control.  \n\nSomalia is making good progress in core reform areas such as the establishment of the Somalia Financial Management Information System, mechanisms for fiscal transfers between the federal government and federal member states, and improved central bank oversight and supervision. To date, the government has successfully conducted two Staff Monitored Program (SMP I and II) and embarked on a third SMP. Somalia has been identified as eligible for debt relief under the Highly Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) initiative given its unsustainable debt levels. The MPF shows a good track record and results which indicates that there are positive causal links between the MPF programs and the progress that Somalia has made since the establishment of the MPF. \n\nThe WB-MPF portfolio has contributed to crucial reforms such as macroeconomic stability and building a track record for arrears clearance and debt relief. There is evidence that potential access to IFI financing, in the relatively short term, and eventual debt relief in the longer term, are proving powerful incentives for reforms, particularly in public finance management. The MPF private sector development support has been critical for business reforms and engaging the private sector. Developing the Somali private sector is imperative to Somalia\u2019s peace and prosperity, and the government and donors need to work closely with the private sector on economic growth priorities. Nevertheless, the challenges for Somalia are still daunting in many areas such as improving macro-fiscal framework, implementing crucial tax measures to raise revenue, enacting key legislation, forging a political consensus on a federal model and strengthening the capacity of key institutions. \n\nOverall risk level in Somalia:\nViolence and armed conflict as well as political instability are some of the main obstacles to economic and social development in Somalia. Apart from the political and security challenges, Somalia is in a difficult humanitarian situation. Climate change and recurring periods of drought regularly affect the population and its resilience is low after decades of conflict and instability. More concretely, the following general risks that can negatively affects the MPF programs have been identified:\n\u2022\tWorsened security situation and increased Al-Shabaab attacks that can destabilize the country.\n\u2022\tSomalia\u00b4s transition as well as clan/fraction related local conflicts.\n\u2022\tHigh level of corruption and culture of nepotism affecting MPF programs.\n\u2022\tPolitical instability due to the federalization process as well as upcoming elections (both FMS level and federal level).\n\u2022\tRecurrent natural disasters and/or conflict might disrupt the World Bank's MPF long term development interventions where donors might have to re-prioritize or re-program available funds depending on the severity of the shocks. This might affect donor contributions to the MPF and available funds to MPF, meaning less contributions to the MPF.\n\nThe appraisal memorandum has been written in English, as English-speaking personnel at the Embassy in Nairobi participate in the appraisal and follow-up of the contribution, in accordance with the General Director's decision regarding choice of language as per the instructions from 1 March 2013.",

        "description": "SPIDER was founded as a center for expertise concerning ICT for development at Sida's initiative and was initially housed by the Royal Institute of Technology and later by Stockholm University, which is Sida's agreement partner. Sida has since continued to provide a multi-year non-earmarked support to SPIDER. SPIDER acts as the Swedish operational counterpart and advisor for a number of Sida\u2019s ICT for development (ICT4D) projects in countries prioritized by Sida. SPIDER mobilizes a network of Swedish and international experts in the area of information and communications technology (ICT) for development to help developing countries use ICT as a tool to efficiently and strategically drive development and poverty reduction goals - in this case, in the area of health. The proposed initiative aims to establish a National Health Management Information System (HMIS) in Somalia. There is no such initiative currently in the country. Establishing an effective HMIS is included in WHO's six basic building blocks for health systems. Current fragmentation and lack of data and information make it difficult, if not impossible, for Somali healthcare providers to plan, manage and deliver quality healthcare across the country in a cost-effective manner.\n\nSPIDER proposes an initial 12-month start-up phase during which SPIDER will conduct a review of the current data and information situation and capacity in Somalia, analysis of regional needs, including an assessment of the health system in the two selected regions (Galmudug and Puntland), recruitment and posting of project staff and mapping of relevant stakeholder. The two selected regions were determined by SPIDER in consultation with the Federal Ministry of Health in Somalia. The two selected regions reflect the current healthcare system in Somalia. The Galmudug region represents one of the weakest health systems with limited capacity and reach. The Galumudug region is also partially controlled by Al-Shabaab, which makes it difficult to access critical maternal and child health care. The Puntland region, on the other hand, has one of the most developed health systems in Somalia's federal government. The region is quite stable, and the Ministry of Health has sufficient capacity and experience compared to Galmudug. SPIDER also proposes to create a central hub for data storage and management in Mogadishu. Lessons learned from the first introductory phase will guide decisions to scale up the initiative to other regions. In summary, the project aims to design, establish and deliver a health information management system for that is suitable for Somalia's infrastructure and public health needs. The development of HMIS is an important issue for the federal government and is included among seen health care priorities.",

The project will seek to improve the retention of already enrolled children living in flood-affected areas into the quality and inclusive basic education in a safe and protective learning environment. \n\nThe project will target and support 8,750 children (40% girls) in 20 schools, the most affected schools will be selected in coordination with regional coordinators will receive light rehabilitation and furnishing of desks and chairs, provision of teaching and learning materials to 8,750 learners from 20 schools, provision of dignity kits to 2000 adolescent girls to enhance their daily school attendance, provision of recreational materials to 20 schools that are tailored to the needs of children, Provision of community-based psychosocial support in schools, the establishment of 20 temporary child-friendly spaces (CFS) that will support the provision of PSS, recreational activities and non-formal education activities. On the protection front, the project will identify specific protection needs, inform service provision and serve as an entry point for specialized service provision with boys and girls. Targeted psychosocial support, psychological first aid, case management, and emergency referrals will be provided to child survivors of rights violations, Unaccompanied and Separated Children (UASC), and children who show signs of trauma. 500 children will be targeted for IDTR and PSS provided, of which 30% expected to be reunified with their families. \n\nThe proposed intervention will create synergies with existing programs focusing on child protection. The caseworkers and monitors in the present proposal will act as a reference for the referral pathways aiming at connecting services in the communities. Before starting the implementation, HIWA will coordinate with Shelter, protection, WASH, and CCCM to ensure complementarity and reinforcement of the project approach. HIWA has a strong experience in child protection in emergency and in resilience context and has previously implemented child protection programs funded by UNICEF in Beletweyne and Buula Burte, through this experience HIWA has established linkages with community leaders, local authorities and camp leaders making access and acceptance easier in the target locations. HIWA will coordinate with the regional education cluster during the implementation of the project. Coordination with WASH cluster will be essential in implementing the project, HIWA will work closely with Wash partner who will carry out hygiene promotion in schools and also ensure the water sources in the schools are safe.\n\nOpportunities for cross-sectoral collaboration within and beyond the HIWA education and protection sectors will be sought. The collaboration will include emergency operations with cluster partners to ensure a comprehensive approach and view of education and child protection. HIWA will use the strength of its relationship with the regional education and protection clusters to share information and collaborate in service provision to avoid duplication of activities in the selected schools. Before implementation starts, HIWA will liaise with the regional coordination structure to identify schools that have not been targeted by other partners. HIWA will also closely work with Relief International and Qatar foundation on hygiene promotion and other WASH interventions. Referrals will be directed to them where WASH needs are identified in different schools.",

RI will procure quality, local adapted seeds, appropriate tools and safety gear, and promote environmentally friendly vector control and organic fertilizer approaches. With demonstration plots and other community awareness activities, RI will disseminate GAP and other best practices through the agricultural community to increase productivity, control vectors responsibly, store seeds effectively, and boost livelihoods. To support increased yields and stimulate the local economy, RI will clear and rehabilitate irrigation canals with laborers in a cash for work (CfW) scheme. RI will coordinate with other food security partner to ensure in-kind and/or cash support to The proposed intervention will contribute to a successful late-crop harvest in early 2020 to avert a pre-famine emergency.

Mindful of the Somali context and utilizing its expertise in target locations, AVORD will pay attention to issues of diversity in the targeting process. List of beneficiaries along with their contact numbers will be availed to the Somalia Humanitarian Fund (SHF) and other actors responding in the area to avoid overlap. \n\n7,300 registered household will be provided with 1 NFI kit comprising of 1 Plastic Sheet, 3 Blankets, 2 Sleeping Mats, 1 Kitchen Set, 1 Mosquito Net, 1 Solar Torch and 2 Jerry Cans with the capacity of 10 Liters each. The proposed content in each set is based on current Shelter Cluster standards for people in humanitarian emergencies. In addition to NFIs, emergency shelters will be constructed for 300 most vulnerable IDPs (150 households in Beletweyn and 150 households in Jowhar). Each shelter will be constructed using assorted local sticks of various sizes, 4 plastic sheets, 1 kg of Nails of size 5, 1 kg of nails size 6, a drum door, door hinges and outer buul clothing, as per the BOQ and technical designs uploaded along with the present proposal. In the construction of these shelters, the project team will ensure adequate separation between individual household shelters and that pathways exist to provide all-weather access to individual dwellings and facilities. AVORD will closely coordinate with relevant line ministries of Hirshabelle to secure land tenure for a minimum of 3 years before the construction of emergency shelters. \n\nThe effectiveness of the aid package will be ascertained through Post Distribution Monitoring exercise thus ensuring that beneficiaries access their services safely and in a dignified manner. An elaborate feedback and complain mechanism will be setup to ensure accountability to the affected population.\n\nIn the delivery of the proposed package, AVORD will seek Integration with other clusters and own interventions in the region to ensure complementarity, value for money and efficiency of the response.",

        "description": "Increased rainfall since the beginning of September in both Ethiopian highlands and within the catchments in Somalia has resulted in a sharp rise in the Shabelle and Juba rivers, leading to severe flooding in southern and central Somalia. According to UNHCR-Protection Return Monitoring Network (PRMN), the recent Shabelle river flooding displaced over 270,000 people, of whom 230,000 are in Beletweyne District. Farmland, infrastructure and roads have been destroyed, and livelihoods disrupted in some of the worst-hit areas. According to the FAO-led Somalia Water and Land Information Management (SWALIM), the rains are projected to continue in the coming weeks and it is expected to end in early December. DRC proposes to undertake a life-saving and sustainable assistance to Flood- Displaced people in Beletweyne through provision of emergency shelter kits (ESK), non-food items (NFIs). DRC will target 2050 households (12,300 people) with ESK and NFIs. The standard emergency NFI package will include plastic sheeting, blankets, sleeping mats, kitchen set, mosquito net, solar lamp and Jerry cans. Where possible, DRC will give the NFIs through cash transfers or vouchers so that beneficiaries can decide based on their needs. DRC will also assist with a standard ESK that contains: Local available stick for vertical post (Philippian Tree) Local available sticks for truss, door and windows (Philippian Tree) or White wood (8cm x 4cm size each) Local available sticks (Philippian Tree) for horizontal frames amp roofing or White wood (5cm x 2.5cm size each) Local available sticks (Philippian Tree) at the base of roof truss or White wood (10cm x 2.5cm size each) Nails No. 5 (5 inch) Nails No. 6 (6 inch) Drum door with frame Hinges for door Local plastic sheet (size: 4m x 7m) and outer wall clothing Buul layer. This provides the most basic shelter which can offer protection from extreme weather. The ESK helps the displaced household to put up by a 4m x 4m shelter structure within the first few days of displacement. DRC is aware that the needs are huge and the available funding cannot cover everyone. DRC is also aware that families of affected persons are normally the first responders and therefore, some families may be better positioned to survive such disaster due to their own social networks. Therefore DRC will develop a selection criteria based on AGD as well as vulnerability to ensure that assistance goes to the ones who deserve it most. Female-headed households, families with many children and the aged (65+ year-olds) will be given priority. DRC will also ensure that, persons living with disabilities (PLDs) or families with such persons are also targeted with assistance.  Families considered extremely vulnerable, will be assisted by DRC to put up their shelter through cash paid after erection. DRC determines that this cash shall be 60 USD and targets 540 hhs out of 2050 hhs. DRC will undertake a post-distribution monitoring (PDM) study four (4) weeks after distribution to measure the effectiveness of distribution and also the satisfaction of the beneficiaries on the items distributed. This will help inform future programming in shelter, NFIs and CCCM programming. Specific to CCCM, DRC shall engage in installation of solar lights and in settlement maintenance including clearance of any solid waste and access roads. DRC will also, jointly with the camp/settlement committees undertake mapping of available services and establish a referral system. Through that, DRC will establish information boards at strategic points like social centers like water points and markets for people to have easy access to information. DRC will support community governance structures through trainings to ensure that camp/settlement committees can manage their daily issues in a structured manner. At sub-national level, DRC will ensure coordination of CCCM meetings happen and deliberations are reported.",

        "description": "Flood triggered displacement is on the rise in Middle Shebelle, with new areas engulfed by floods water during the wet season every day. The displaced population is fleeing to high grounds leaving behind household assets completely submerged by water. Safe locations hosting displaced populations lack basic services including safe drinking water and sanitation services. The impact of this is a high incidence of water-borne diseases, growing protection concerns faced by women and girls, conflict activated by sharing of scarce resources and denying the right to access service subjected to people with disabilities, minority groups, and elderly people.\n\nIn this context, PAH will implement a WASH cluster-specific intervention aiming to 1) deliver life-saving WASH assistance to reduce acute need among the vulnerable settlement and communities 2) reduce risk of violence against women, children and vulnerable groups accessing WASH services 3) provide or restore sustainable access to safe water and adequate sanitation services in the targeted communities and institutions.\n\nFloods affected population is farming communities who rely on farming as the main source of livelihood to provide them with income and promote the local economy. PAH has conducted market analysis to assess the capacity of local markets to provide needed WASH items and determine the preference of the affected population. Most interviewed households preferred to be engaged in latrines construction. Based on market capacity and community preference, and building on its previous experience, PAH will construct emergency latrines through cash for work approach selecting skilled individuals from the target population and sourcing construction materials from local vendors pre-identified during the market analysis.\n\n\nTo reduce the negative impact of risky practices and minimize the risk of disease outbreak hygiene kits will be provided to displaced families. The content of the kits will meet cluster standards but will be topped-up with mosquito nets to protect children, pregnant women and elderly persons from malaria. Community-based hygiene promoters will be trained and WASH committees established to promote safe practices.\n\nPAH will implement these activities in the Jowhar district of the Middle Shebelle region. Approximately 13,890 people from 2315 HHs (households) will benefit from this intervention. PAH is one of the main WASH actors fully present in Middle Shebelle implementing emergency and resilience WASH activities in Jowhar and has easy access to crisis-affected locations. PAH is already responding to the flood crisis in Jowhar and is providing lifesaving WASH services including safe water and hygiene kits to 768 displaced people. To address malnutrition PAH is providing 2 months unrestricted cash transfer to 400 most vulnerable families who have lost crops and have malnourished household members. However, the increasing risks and absence of WASH services require immediate scale-up to avert further displacement and disease outbreak. Moreover, PAH will create synergies for improved coordination among WASH stakeholders in the area, including local authorities, clusters, and other NGOs.",

Heavy rains of more than 100mm are expected in Hiraan, Bay and Bakool regions which are already saturated following weeks of continued heavy rains. In South West State, an estimated 70,000 people have been affected and another 40,000 displaced by flash flooding across the region. Berdale town (60 km west of Baidoa) is worst affected. Three quarters of the town is submerged. Local authorities and humanitarian partners estimate that 30,000 people have been affected. The road to Berdale is impassable. Humanitarian partners are working with authorities to scale up the response in the affected areas INTERSOS is targeting to provide emergency WASH response to the floods affected population in Berdale as in line with the needs assessment report conducted by Inter-Agency to quickly identify the vast damages affected by the floods and the priority needs to immediately intervene the humanitarian situation. The report highlighted that around 360 unprotected shallow wells, which is 85% of the total shallow wells in Berdale, have been submerged by the floodwater. The IDPs and Host communities in the district depends on boreholes and shallow wells as their main source of water which is critical to survive after it has been submerged by the flash floods. The price of one drum of water (200ltr) is 20,000 Somali shilling which is approximately 1 USD therefore, 95% of the Berdale residents have no access to safe water supply due to the pool stagnant water and submerged of all other shallow wells by the floods.\n\nINTERSOS is the focal point for Berdale flood response in collaboration with all partners and cluster leads for distribution of hygiene kits, NFIs and medical supplies mobilized and channeled into INTERSOS. In this regards, INTERSOS will ensure to adhere and coordinate with other partners for identification of vulnerable communities and avoiding overlapping of responses and mitigating to improve the coordination system among partners on ground. \n  \n\nThe   objective of the response is to provide lifesaving emergency WASH assistance to 6500 HH from the  most vulnerable population affected by the floods in Berdale district to improve the access of clean and safe water through provision of water tracking, hygiene promotion and shallow wells rehabilitations. The proposed response aims to increase the access of clean safe water to the community and decreases the acute watery diarrhea/cholera outbreaks and waterborne diseases, which is one of the priorities in the HRP strategy of INTERSOS and in line with the SHF reserve allocation of 2019 for the flood response. The project will enable INTERSOS to convert proposed immediate needs outlined by the Inter-agency report into immediate interventions to respond the floods affected communities in Berdale.  \n\nINTERSOS will address the sanitation and hygiene practices among the target beneficiaries through hygiene promotion, distribution of hygiene kits and provision of water purified tablets and water treatment of all water sources through training of water management committees, community volunteers and hygiene promoters with water treatment and chlorination. The project also targets to improve the knowledge, attitude and practices of the community for sanitation and hygiene practices at community and household level to ensure access in water quality and enhancing the level of understanding to the community in public ownership for regular monitoring and supervision. \nThroughout this proposed lifesaving assistance, INTERSOS will provide WASH packages and services to approximately 25,000 beneficiaries (host community and IDPs) of which 8,937 are women and 7,313 men. 4,812 out of the targeted proposed beneficiaries are girls and 3,938 will be boys  . \n\n30 community volunteers will be trained",

Also this project is working to rehabilitate WASH facilities damaged by the floods including repair, disinfection and protection against further flooding. It will contribute to the reduction of emergency WASH gaps reported and works to improve the hygiene practices of the affected communities through kit distribution and awareness campaigns. \nThe project is for 6 months targeting a total beneficiary of 30,000 individuals living in Baldweyn. This reserve allocation will enable QC to scale up flood responses in Beledweyn and reach more beneficiaries in the coming months. \n1.\tThis Project will work to provide emergency water trucking through voucher to flood affected communities in Beledweyn. Currently, potential high-risk areas for the water trucking activities are areas where people are displaced to. A total of 2,500 households equivalent to 15,000 people will be supported  with water voucher for 3 months and each person will be provided 15 l/p/d (acceptable WASH cluster standards in Somalia), with total of 2,520 trucks.\nQC will also provide water to health/nutrition facilities and schools within the target communities. QC will competitively contract water vendors to supply households with agreed quantities over the specified period. Households provided with vouchers will access their allocation of water at the water distribution point on a daily basis. The community water monitors will register the collection of the water in a register book with the household representative and signing or thumb print as a record. All the supplied water will be chlorinated. In addition, a list of recommended boreholes will be mapped out for water trucking. This list will also be shared with suppliers before contracting them.\n2.\tIn addition to the access for drinking water, the proposed project will ensure to improve hygiene practices among the flood-affected people through hygiene kit distribution from WASH supply hub and hygiene promotion awareness. 60 community hygiene promotes will be trained and supported to conduct hygiene awareness and best hygiene practices. This will reduce the risk of AWD/cholera outbreak and improves the sanitation of the targeted Households.\n3.\tAs part of community sanitation improvement and protection against water borne diseases, the proposed project will replace and construct 220 flood resistant latrines through owner driven approach in which QC providers construction materials through voucher system in addition to the labor incentives as cash transfer. Also rehabilitation of 40 institutional latrines in damaged health facilities, schools and public institutions. In addition to this, project will work to repair and disinfect 30 damaged water sources (Shallow wells) and protect them against further flooding. \n\nWith the funds from SHF, QC will work closely with state level and local level authorities, local elders, community members and floods affected population to undertake and determine the project beneficiaries. During the beneficiary identification process QC will consider child-headed households, households headed by disabled persons or elderly persons without support Households with children under 5 poor female-headed households poor households with children admitted in nutrition programs, poor pregnant and lactating women. Public verification will be made which will surely encourage accountability, transparency and fair selection. The project will extend feedback and compliant mechanism already in place where beneficiaries can be able to present their concerns for assistance. A monitoring and evaluation system will also be extended to this project to ensure that project progresses are in line with the objective and intended WASH outcomes.",

Specifically, the project will provide emergency and flood-resistant sanitation services, rehabilitate water systems, including repair, disinfection, and reinforcement against further flooding, and promote improved hygiene practices. Relief International (RI) will prioritize the rehabilitation and reinforcement of damaged water and sanitation infrastructure to withstand future floods. In the rehabilitation of latrines at household, communal and institutional levels, RI will adopt flood-resistant design and construction methods. Specifically, RI will train masons on flood- resistant latrine construction techniques, procure construction materials, and incentivize the rehabilitation of targeted latrines through vouchers. RI will assess the damage and strategically rehabilitate, reinforce for flood resistance, and disinfect strategic water points. Newly flood-displaced people will have increased access to safe water from RI contracted water trucking companies. To minimize overlap, RI will continue to liaise with Qatar Charity and Save the Children on water trucking targeting. Through the regional WASH cluster and the government-led floods taskforce, RI will coordinate with government, UN agencies, and NGO partners on the response. RI will solicit feedback from community members on their needs and other support they may be receiving from other sources to appropriately target the proposed interventions and minimize overlap and duplication. Through a CfW scheme, able-bodied community members will establish a disposal site to dispose appropriately of debris that has accumulated due to floods. With in-kind hygiene kits distributed to flood-affected households and targeted dissemination of hygiene promotion messages, RI will promote improved hygiene. RI will leverage its health and nutrition data to target hotspots for acute diarrheal disease. This case tracing approach will support the proactive targeting of people in need of hygiene promotion, hygiene kits, safe water, and latrines. Trained hygiene promoters will complement case tracing with routine interaction with community members and door-to-door household hygiene awareness campaigns. RI will target newly flood-displaced people in settlements and after they return. RI will assess the situation at the time of implementation to ensure that newly flood-displaced are primarily targeted. These interventions will improve wellbeing, prevent morbidity, and restore dignity for flood-affected communities in Beletweyne.",

Already at least 6.3 million people, nearly half of the country\u2019s population are affected by the situation. More than 548,000 people in Somalia have been forced to flee their homes due to flooding in the Hiran region (Belet Weyne, Buuloburto and Jalalaqsi) including children (OCHA report Nov.). Belet Weyne town and the surrounding areas of Hiran region of Somalia is the worst affected where more than 140,000 people are already flee from their homes with empty handed and displaced highland locations, while some households displaced to their relatives living non flood affected areas, putting burden to already vulnerable communities with limited resources (food and water). Authorities and the local community members are trying to mitigate the impact of the floods in residential areas. However, flood risks are still high considering the flow of water to downstream areas of River Shabelle as water levels in Belet Weyne are receding. In this proposal, AADSOM will improve access to safe water, sanitation facilities and promote good hygiene practices to reduce the negative impacts of the flood in Jalalaqsi district. Under this allocation, AADSOM will improve better access to clean water, use of latrines and increased health promotion and safe hygiene practices to 20,000 women, men, boys and girls including people with disabilities and marginalized communities affected by the current floods. Key activities AADSOM would like to undertake within this project include:\n- Provision of safe water to 1000 households representing 6,000 men, women and children affected population through water vendors (water trucking) by using Water Voucher (WV) \n- Upgrade/Rehabilitation of one strategic borehole equipped with hybrid system and rehabilitation of flood damaged 20 shallow wells with hand pumps. \n- Capacity building of 11 WASH committees and 42 Well Operators to ensure continuity of service, operation and maintenance, coupled training on DDR and conflict resolution mechanisms as cross cutting\n- Construction flood destructed 214 gender separated and flood proof latrines and 6 gender sensitive flood proof institutional latrines in Nasrudin Primary School with lockable doors to avoid GBV against women and girls and washing basin benefiting around 245 students.\n- Conducting comprehensive hygiene promotion campaigns to reach 20,000 men, women, boys and girls through visiting house to house, schools, health centers and feeding centers \n-Training 15 community hygiene promoters, who will carry out hygiene promotion activities during and after the project is faced out and \n-Distribution of 1000 HP kits to 1000 households (UNICEF will supply) with vulnerable populations served by the established water services. \nThe proposed response took into consideration the impact of women, and children in terms of access to WASH services.

The nutrition cluster priority districts in Hiran region including Beletweyne due to critical levels of GAM rate at 19.6 and SAM of 4.1. The project is designed in such a way that while providing emergency lifesaving interventions it will also provide longer term sustainable solutions for affected populations. To ensure the emergency interventions are linked to durable solutions, the project includes construction, rehabilitation and upgrading of water supply systems and promotion of hygiene and sanitation services.\n\nThe project will contribute to improving equitable access to quality life-saving curative and preventative health, nutrition and WASH services through the support of static health facilities and mobile outreach to the flood affected populations in Hiran, particularly Beletweyne District. There will be 8 sites that will provide integrated health and nutrition services for flood affected communities, offering outpatient consultations, routine immunization, maternal healthcare, disease surveillance and health promotion as well as systematic identi\ufb01cation, referral and treatment of acutely malnourished cases by providing integrated nutrition services to OTPs, TSFP, IYCF-E and referral to stabilization centers. Micronutrient supplementation, promotion of IYCF practices, promoting the adoption of good hygiene and sanitation practices will also be provided. Special focus will be given to prevention of disease outbreak and malnutrition, improve early identification malnutrition by empowering mothers to use MUAC screening, access to primary health care, and therefore reduce excess morbidity and mortality. \n\nThe WASH component in health and nutrition will also improve good hygiene practices, rehabilitation of WASH infrastructure, more equitable and better access to sustainable water points for drinking and handwashing with soap, and provision of basic sanitation services in these facilities. Hygiene and sanitation support and promotion will be provided in an integrated approach in the health and nutrition sites. There will also be outreach nutrition, hygiene and health promotion within the community and in schools. This will empower children to be agents of change for hygiene promotion.",

The Consortium has offices and representation in Mogadishu, Hargeisa, Garowe, Baidoa, Kismayo and plans to expand its reach to constituencies in the remaining federal states through extensive outreach work from the current offices. The SNC expects to reach 100 NGOs by end of 2019 which will increase membership needs. The SNC is currently co-funded through Swiss Development Cooperation (SDC), Somalia Humanitarian Fund (SHF), OFDA (USAID), Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA) and membership subscription fees. Legal and contractual responsibilities associated with funding and contracting are held by host agencies, as SNC is not a legally constituted entity, but rather a network of its membership. During the relocation process in 2019, the SNC has gone through transitions on multiple levels including management and relocation form Nairobi to Mogadishu. Our costs and needs from our membership have significantly increased and significant positions are left unfilled including Advocacy Officer, Deputy Director and Grants amp Partnership Officer. SNC's annual budget for 2020 is estimated to be around $1,409,806 USD. Further information can be found below on budget secured and proposals submitted.",

        "description": "TThe NGO safety program was established in 2004 to support NGOs operating in Somalia in terms of staff safety. In this complex context, NGOs face strong challenges related to access and security, including: a lack of understanding of the context difficulty to access and to verify information a lack of information sharing a lack of security coordination and harmonized security practices poor security awareness of staff and a lack of training opportunities. This safety platform is managed since April 2015 by INSO.\n\nIn response to and following the guidance of an Advisory Board (which is composed by 4 INGOs and 1 LNGOs), the project focuses on two main pillars of action which can be summarized as Information, Analysis and Advice, and Preparedness and Response. The two pillars are strongly interconnected: NGOs need accurate and timely security information to base their decisions on, while they need the proper safety training to organize and take relevant security decisions. Finally, in case an incident takes place, NGOs receive adequate support.\n\nThrough INSO\u2019s own network of Deputy Safety Advisors and Safety Advisor Assistants, NGO reports, collaboration with other security actors and media follow up, INSO collects, verifies, compiles and analyses security incidents. Besides, since 2010, the project has developed a database of more than 41,000 incidents that constitutes a unique tool for data analysis. The INSO field teams help NGOs on the ground to deal with daily security incidents, such as arrests, accidents and threats, while the INSO senior management team can provide support to critical incidents such as kidnappings, abductions, injuries and medical evacuations. The extent of INSO involvement is determined by the NGO who requests our services.\n\nDue to the peculiar mandate and mission of INSO, its Hargeisa office has a dual role, both as coordination hub and implementer of core INSO activities (such as roundtables, individual briefings, and production of maps and reports). Likewise, senior management (including the Country Director) are highly involved in the direct delivery of our services: they are not just managers but also direct implementers in their role as advisors to other NGOs. \n\nThe project budget leans heavily on HR costs because the project\u2019s core product is knowledge. That\u2019s in essence what INSO\u2019s beneficiaries receive. When the main output of an organization is information, the organization core cost is HR \u2013 same as e.g. an online newspaper or a management consulting firm.",

        "description": "The overall goal of the project is to contribute to improvement of living conditions and access to basic services for displaced in persons by bolstering effectiveness of coordination mechanisms and community led governance structures in Luuq which is a CCCM under-served area. The envisaged actions will set the foundation for attaining durable solutions through strengthened community self-management. DRC will facilitate the analysis of needs and intervention gaps within IDP sites in Luuq, initiating advocacy for support to respond to identified needs and gaps, as well as protection concerns. DRC will also contribute to the administrating and documenting regular cluster meetings in collaboration with UNHCR. DRC will engage local authorities including governmental and community leadership to work towards durable solutions for displaced populations. \n\nThe project will engage implementing partners and relevant authorities on identified needs, gaps, and overlaps. Furthermore, DRC will advocate for and support the adoption of an area-based approach for service delivery in IDP sites. The project will conduct training of relevant government authorities in CCCM principles to enhance their understanding of humanitarian assistance through the CCCM model.\n\nDRC will take on responsibility for targeted IDP sites to undertake the following:\n- Map out existing governance structures and focal points at the targeted IDP sites. Where governance structures exist, their capacity will be built in camp management and other essential principles. Where these governance structures are absent, DRC will facilitate their establishment through the creation of Camp Management Committees (CMCs).\n- Monitor service delivery in the IDP sites through CCCM Mobile Teams to identify any service gaps and overlaps of interventions by implementing agencies.\n- Reinforce accountability to displaced populations through increasing communication and feedback on availability of services. This will be done through multiple approaches including construction and establishment of community centers for information hubs, and through awareness raising campaigns about site services. Furthermore, DRC will establish and strengthen complaint and feedback mechanisms (CFMs) in sites. For referrals, DRC will work with existing protection stakeholders on appropriate and principled referrals, with particular attention to protection concerns, and service delivery to persons with special needs.\n- Work to improve site safety and hygiene through a participatory approach, utilizing a cash-for-work modality to carry out site maintenance activities. This additionally links participating IDP residents to temporary income and encourages ownership of the site. Site safety audits and fire hazard training will also be conducted.\n\nBeneficiary description:\nThe proposed intervention supports multiple stakeholders through camp management activities at the targeted five IDP sites with the aim of increased coordination at the site level, for displaced populations in  Luuq, where the established governance structures will hold monthly coordination meetings at the site level to discuss gaps and needs of IDP residents so that these identified gaps and needs will be taken  to the relevant humanitarian partners who assist in filling those gaps at the targeted sites.\nAt the present time, based on discussions with relevant stakeholders, DRC has selected the following sites to support:\n1.Ban Munduli (Akaro) - 715 H\u2019H\n2.Buyle - 520 H\u2019H\n3.Luuq Hilaac - 355 H\u2019H\n4.Jazeera - Jadiid - 450 H\u2019H\n5.Luuq Waaberi - 460 H\u2019H",

The project intervention is timely significant to address and respond to the education cluster and drought response plan (June-December 2019) strategies: i) prioritize education support to children where they live and ii) education opportunity to children in place where they move to ensure they can continue their education. Education is critical during emergencies like drought. It protects children from risks and protection related concerns. School-aged children will be provided lifesaving education intervention to schools they are currently learning to prevent the risk of dropout as well as mitigate the protection risks. Equally, school-aged children who are displaced by the drought will be reached out to their places to ensure they have access to quality education and protection services in locations they moved to the proposed project will be targeting 4000 school aged children affected by the drought in 18 schools in Belethawa (4 schools), Bardhere (4 schools), Luuq (5 schools), Garbaharey (2 schools) and Burdhubo(3). The project will target 4000 school-aged drought affected children in Gedo (2,200 boys and 1,800 girls). Education specific activities will include the provision of education supplies: As per the education minimum standard on teaching and learning materials, learners and teachers will be provided learning materials in accordance to set standards. Each grade 1-3 student will receive learning kit consisting of 7 books (6 single ruled and 1 single Squared100 sheets), 4 pencils, 4 rubbers and 2 sharpeners while students between Grade 4 and 8 will receive  7 books ((6 single ruled and 1 single Squared 100 sheets), 2 pens,2 rubbers , 1 sharpener and one student mathematics set. Bags will be given the girls provided for the sanitary kits to carry their sanitary materials to the schools to reduce their absence during menstrual period, emergency school feeding to promote retention of learners, emergency teacher incentives to motivate teachers, training of teachers and CECs on education and child protection, and sanitary kits for adolescent girls to encourage their regular attendance at school. WASH Specific activities will include water trucking to the schools and construction of water storages (Barkets), the construction of gender segregated school latrines with hand-washing facilities.  As education is lifesaving, protection mainstreaming will be key and critical to ensure children have access to protective learning environment. HIRDA will conduct protection service mapping in the target schools. The members will be able to identify children with protection concern both at the school and community. They also, help in organising children led social mobilization campaign in the community. Also, organise structured recreational activities in the school4000 (1800 girls) learners will be provided with recreational materials as per the education cluster minimum standard. Children in the target locations will have access to structured recreational play in the schools. Through the recreational materials, children will have access to play and interact with other children. Children clubs will also be established in the target schools.\n\nHIRDA has been active education partner as well as nutrition and health. Based on its vast experienced field staff who benefited trainings offered by the education cluster and UNICEF, HIRDA will be directly implementing this project. The project will complement the ongoing alternative basic education, health and nutrition programmes funded by UNICEF. School-aged children will have access to nutrition screening exercise to identify children with acute malnutrition and treated. Equally, the health HIRDA team will prioritise the target schools to ensure children are dewormed and treated communicable diseases and illnesses.",

        "description": "The proposed project seeks to improve  immediate access to food and to protect and restore the livelihood-related food and income sources for the most vulnerable rural H.H living in rural  Baidoa villages in Bay region - Somalia. The project targets 1,350 households comprising of 8,247 boys, girls, women and Men. Project period will be 6 months. The primary target will be the most vulnerable families under the integrated food security classification (IPC) 3 and above that are currently living in  rural Baidoa villages. Target will be mainly villages of northern Baidoa namely Lawiiley (9km), Midow (12km) and Maaranka (15km) and small villages around these three. The assistance will be emergence-oriented agricultural support to 1350 rain fed farmers living in the target villages to secure harvest in the coming Deyr rainy season. The project will provide each family a package of farming seeds (sorghum (30kg) and cowpea (10kg)) and farming tools. The beneficiary farmers will be trained on the best agricultural practice/ good agricultural practice (GAP) to enhance and develop their capacities on farming. \nComplementary unconditional cash transfer (UCT) will be transferred to the target beneficiaries in a period of 3 months to improve immediate food access during the lean season. The monthly rate of the cash transfer is $30/family. This complies with March 2019 minimum expenditure basket (MEB) value recommended by CMWG in May 2019. It is anticipated that the cash transfer support will improve their food consumption, nutritional status of the children and reduce the use of negative coping mechanisms that exposes women, children and other vulnerable groups to the risk of displacement. \nWith the funds from SHF, QC will work closely with state level and local level authorities, local elders, community members and drought affected population to undertake and determine the project beneficiaries. During the beneficiary identification process QC will consider child-headed households, households headed by disabled persons or elderly persons without support Households with children under 5 poor female-headed households poor households with children admitted in nutrition programs, poor pregnant and lactating women. Public verification will be made which will surely encourage accountability, transparency and fair selection. The project will extend feedback and compliant mechanism already in place where beneficiaries can be able to present their concerns for assistance.",

        "title": "Providing Emergency Unconditional Cash Transfers to Vulnerable Households in Diinsoor",
        "description": "The underperforming Deyr rains in 2018 and Gu rains in 2019 have heavily impacted the lives and livelihoods of households in Diinsoor which has led to an increase in the number of households in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis) and IPC Phase 4 (emergency). Rural populations in the hard-to-reach and undeserved areas around Diinsoor have been severely affected as result of poor agricultural production and limited access to services due to limited coverage by aid agencies. Household debt levels in this area remain high with many households utilizing negative coping mechanisms as a means to survive this lean period. Findings from a rapid needs assessment conducted by ACTED in Diinsoor on 16 and 23 June found that 62% of households do not regularly meet their food needs. Due to this dire situation, ACTED proposes an emergency short-term response to address the acute food insecurity and alleviate the humanitarian needs. The project will provide life-saving support to 1,614 vulnerable and drought affected households (9,684 individuals) through unconditional cash transfers in Diinsoor. ACTED plans to distribute four-months of consecutive unconditional cash transfers to these households from August until November 2019. Overall, these activities align with the Food Security cluster objective to improve households\u2019 immediate access to food through provision of conditional and unconditional assistance depending on the severity of food insecurity phase vulnerability and seasonality of the livelihoods. Moreover, the project aligns with the Somalia HRP 2019 objective to provide life-saving and life sustaining integrated assistance to reduce acute humanitarian needs and excess mortality among the most vulnerable people. Unconditional cash transfers act as a measure to prevent further deterioration of the food security of households and act as a buffer against the continued impact of the failed rains. These unconditional transfers in Diinsoor provide a quick response to increasing needs and enable households to access the functioning markets in Diinsoor.",

        "description": "FSNAU forecasts worsening food security and nutrition situation in the (2nd -3rd quarters) of 2019 in middle Shabelle region. Poor nutrition may deteriorate further with delayed rain and the impending drought. The FSNAU projects the GAM in Balcad district at 16% and SAM at 3.1%. The Nutrition Cluster estimates about 2,900 SAM cases annually in Balcad district with an estimated population of about 210,000 (including 21,000 IDPs). Zamzam in partnership with UNICEF has been providing integrated health and nutrition services in Bal'ad district since 2007 and this call for proposals (Reserve drought 2019) will serve to ensure the continuation of project activities to mitigate drought impact and cover the nutrition/health needs of children , women and men at target locations. The proposed project, which will be implemented from July 2019-July 2020 will provide a package of life-saving integrated interventions for vulnerable populations, including women and children, affected by drought conditions in targeted areas in Bal'ad district. Under this project, Zamzam will scale up its intervention through two integrated health/nutrition sites and 2 mobile outreach services targeting 35000 drought-affected people of 55% are women and girls. Zamzam proposes the following health/nutrition interventions: \n\n1. Deliver integrated Health, Nutrition services through two fixed health facilities and 2 mobile teams : The services to be provided include vitamin A supplementation (VAS) for children 6-59 months, immunization for children less than one year and referrals. (at least 4300 children under-5 are given two VAS ,and deworming tablets and immunized(disaggregated by sex). In addition, an estimated 2800 Pregnant women in their 2nd and 3rd trimesters are dewormed. \n2. Outpatient consultations, management of common child illness like Pneumonia , diarrhea , antenatal care services, sexual reproductive health and MISP in emergency. \n3. Screen children for malnutrition and malnourished children (6-59) referred by CNW to appropriate programme (TSFP/OTP, SC) for treatment. The two fixed nutrition/health sites and 2 mobile teams will provide at least 5 out of 9 BNSP components. This will allow us to treat 7000 children with MAM and 2,900 children (6-59 months) with SAM, including 290 with medical complication are treated by August 2020. UNICEF/WFP will provide all the supplies needed for treatment in-kind. \n4. Promote, enable and sustain behaviour change related to improve infant and young child feeding (IYCF-E). Zamzam will implement mother-led MUAC approach and train community health workers on IYCF promotion to allow them to support 5 Pregnant and lactating women receive individual/group counselling for IYCF and increased service uptake at community level.\n5. Capacity building: The capacity of staff will be improved IMCI , IMAM ,Early warning/early response, IYCF -E while the community members will have participate community health education and awareness session on AWD prevention and response. \n6. Improve reporting, monitoring and maintain Integrated Disease Surveillance and action. at least the health/nutrition sites report monthly DHIS/ONA to the government , health and nutrition cluster",

Woccas nutrition and health sectors will employ an integrated strategy to support recovery of severely malnourished persons, prevent deterioration while boosting access to essential healthcare services. We will target pregnant and lactating women (PLW) and children below 5 years (CU5) in the host community, IDPs and returnees  in Adale where we are the secondary rationalized partner. In Adale we will operate 1 static outpatient therapeutic feeding center (fixed OTP) and 2 mobile outpatients therapeutic feeding programme teams (mobile OTPs) targeting 8 locations chosen on the basis of vulnerability and absence of nutrition interventions in the district. The static facility will be established in Cadale town area while the 2 outreach teams will serve 8 locations namely Ceel Xarar, Ceel Yaag, Boos Hareri, Buro Sheikh, Garas Dhagey, Janab, Gudgudud and Gacal Nur. We will engage UNICEF/WFP for backstopping during training of the project staff, community health workers (CHWs) and mothers for the \u201cmothers MUAC approach\u201d, on nutrition screening and case identification, Integrated management of acute malnutrition(IMAM),Infant and young child feeding education (IYCF-E) and Nutrition, health and hygiene promotion (NHHP).The trained staff will be deployed to the targeted locations, mobile/static OTPs where together with the trained mothers will screen CU5 and PLWs. CU5 with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) conditions will be enrolled in the static/mobile OTPs for nutrition and medical rehabilitation. CU5 and PLW with MAM conditions will be referred to TSFP centers. We will open 2 fixed TSFP/BSFP centers, one in Adale town and the other in Haji Cali to be integrated with a fixed nutrition centers operated by WOCCA. Hygiene promoters will be trained on Nutrition, Health and Hygiene Promotion (NHHP), they will disseminate hygiene promotion messages to prevent outbreak and spread of communicable diseases like AWD/cholera. Mothers will be counseled by trained nutrition staff and CHWs on appropriate maternal infant and young child feeding as part of efforts to prevent malnutrition. We will also provide micronutrient support by distributing multiple micronutrients (MMNs) and Vitamin A supplements to PLW and CU5 through the static/mobile facilities. A referral system will be put in place to transfer patients from one component to the next (when the patient condition worsens), or to return to the previous one if the evolution of treatment is satisfactory. In order to boost access to essential healthcare services, we will borrow from the successes of our ended IERT project We will upgrade, equip and properly staff the fixed nutrition centers to provide basic health services to malnutrition affected population by providing access to treatment of common childhood diseases and Health care support to PLW (including ANC and PNC), and EPI. Efforts to improve vaccination in drought-affected and marginalized populations will be integrated into fixed and mobile service delivery mechanisms.  doctors and nurses will be hired for the nutrition centers. emphasis will also be given to social mobilization campaigns to educate communities on common health issues and support implementation of community hygiene Promotion for epidemic outbreak Prevention. UNICEF and WFP have been supporting WOCCA with nutrition supplies and technical guidance on previous nutrition projects, in this project WOCCA will still engage UNICEF and WFP to provide nutrition supplies and technical support for management of SAM and MAM cases.",

The target group will be selected from those impacted by drought with limited humanitarian support due to access difficulties and blockade. \n\nAVORD will adapt systematic approach to beneficiary selection with clear criterion to prioritize the most vulnerable such as the marginalized, unaccompanied children, older persons, persons with disability, single women, pregnant and lactating mothers, single headed-households, persons with chronic illness or psychological condition, large families and/or families with babies, toddlers or children attending school, persons at risk as identified by protection officers and those living in the open or in makeshift buuls without adequate access to shelter. The project team will undertake a vulnerability assessment involving documenting of household profiles in the target area to identify the most vulnerable who are in urgent need for shelter assistance. Data will be collected through a number of methods including structured interviews with households heads, Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) and direct site observation. Collected data to inform beneficiary selection will also be segregated by gender to ensure that no group is left-out. List of beneficiaries along with their contact numbers will be availed to SHF and other actors responding in the area as needed to avoid overlap. Mindful of the Somali context and utilizing its expertise in target locations, AVORD will pay attention to issues of diversity in the targeting process. \n\nFollowing need-based and transparent selection of beneficiaries, AVORD will provide affected households with standard NFI kits comprising of 1 Plastic Sheet, 3 Blankets, 2 Sleeping Mats, I Kitchen Set, 1 Mosquito Net, 1 Solar Torch and 2 Jerry Cans with the capacity of 10 Liters each. The proposed content in each set is based on current Shelter Cluster standards for people in humanitarian emergencies. Since there are no functioning NFI markets in No.50, AVORD will use an in-kind modality for provision of NFIs. Besides, emergency shelters will be constructed for newly displaced households living in the open or under deplorable shelter conditions. In the construction of these shelters, the project team will ensure adequate separation between individual household shelters and that pathways exist to provide all-weather access to individual dwellings and facilities. AVORD will closely coordinate with relevant line ministries of the South West Administration and No.50 District Authorities to secure land tenure for a minimum of 5 years before the construction of emergency shelters.\n\nThe effectiveness of the aid package will be ascertained through Post Distribution Monitoring exercise thus ensuring that beneficiaries access their services safely and in a dignified manner. An elaborate feedback and complain mechanism will be setup to ensure accountability to the affected population.\n\nIn the delivery of the proposed package, AVORD will seek Integration with other clusters and own interventions in the region to ensure complementarity, value for money and efficiency of the response.",

The action is in line with the SHF reserve allocation 2019 hence targeting one of the most undeserved communities in hard to reach areas as prioritized by the call for proposals. Specifically, the project will enable INTERSOS to fill the WASH gaps through provision of sustainable WASH assistance package including innovative solutions that can contribute to durable solutions. \n\nThe overall objective of this response is to provide Sustainable life-saving WASH services to the most vulnerable in Diinsoor district to improve access to safe and sustained water and hygiene educations, reduce acute watery diarrhea AWD/cholera incidences and WASH related diseases through Drilling and equipping of one strategic borehole with solar-diesel hybrid pumping system that will help in lowering the cost of system operation and more importantly lower emission of carbon footprint. Hydrogeological survey will be conducted in Dinsoor town to identify the suitability of ground water. Complete water distribution networks with elevated tanks and water consumption points (water kiosks) will be installed and constructed as per the available designs and BOQs. All water construction works will be constructed through service contracts with reputable water infrastructure companies who will be supervised by INTERSOS Engineer based in Diinsor. INTERSOS will employ local specialised manpower in order to rehabilitate and develop 11 existing shallow-wells through construction and raising of concrete aprons, de-silting to increase the yield of the wells, India mark 2 water pumps will be installed to ease fetching, watering trough will be built to separate the human consumption from livestock water consumption. \n\nMoreover, INTERSOS will introduce manual drilling of wells that are located in the water bed of the water streams or seasonal with pvc pumps. 11 wells will be drilled using this innovative technic. 3 local technicians will be trained and will be given materials and tools to support the population and start a sustainable and profitable business. The safety of water will be guaranteed through water treatment at the water sources while training of water management committees will embed sustainability through improved operations and management and cost recovery measures, water quality monitoring at the source and household level and where necessary will provide remedial measures through awareness raising on safe water handling by regularly conducting sanitary surveys to suspected water sources to identify risk factors, treatment options like chlorination will be done during rehabilitation and development of these wells and boreholes. \n\nIn addition, the project will address the sanitation and hygienic behavior among the target beneficiaries through hygiene promotion and provision of hygiene kits to 1000 households, distribution of water purification tablets to acute watery diarrhea AWD/cholera suspected homes, institutional hygiene promotion. Hygiene promotion will be built on people\u2019s own knowledge of risk and disease prevention to promote positive health-seeking behaviour. \n\nINTERSOS is currently the only INGO present in Diinsor and the only humanitarian actor implementing wash programs in the District as described in the paragraph coordination and complementarities, majority of the sanitation activities will be conducted in the same targeted location through a project funded by the Italian Cooperation moreover, this project will contribute to a nutrition outcome since INTERSOS will enhance complementarities in the same area with an ongoing nutrition project funded by SHF (a scale up of the same project being discussed with UNICEF).\n\nA total of 21800 (5,308 women, 5,376 men, 5,200 girls and 5,916 boys) are expected to benefit from this project action.",

        "description": "FSNAU post deyr 2018 assessment indicated critical levels of acute malnutrition among rural and pastoral populations with critical GAM gt15 and Serious SAM rates reported in Bakool region. The ongoing Gu rains 2019 (April to June) started late and have performed poorly and are likely to further aggravate the vulnerability of drought affected population including IDPs, poor host communities in Elbarde in Bakool region. These IDPs and poor host communities experience limited access to basic services including access to WASH services. The contributing factors include drought, dry jilaal season (January \u2013March 2019), displacement coupled poor WASH infrastructure. The prolonged drought in Bakool region led to limited access to sustained safe drinking water and increased risks related to  acute water diarrhea and malnutrition among population in Elbarde district in Bakool region. \nAccording to HIDIG WASH assessment conducted between 27- 28 May  2019 indicated that majority of affected population (80%) in ELBARDE district can't afford the cost of water due to increased price of water (55% increase) exposing thousands of families to walk more than 45 minutes for water collection which expose women and adolescent girls risks for gender-based violence. The assessment report indicated that, between 70-80% of shallow wells (26/38 wells in the assessed locations) are on open source condition and hence expose to contamination of water and to increases incidences of AWD cases. In addition, HIDIG/UNICEF health facility report in May 2019 indicated that AWD and skin diseases were among top five disease reported. To respond this alarming situation, the proposed project will improve access to WASH services for a total of 23000 drought/AWD affected communities (including 5750 women , 6900 girls, 6900 boys and 3450 men) IDPs and host communities in Elbarde district in Bakool region. The organization proposes sustained solution to improve access to WASH services services of the affected people in line with Somali WASH cluster response plan:\nWater: 1. Provision of sustained access to safe drinking water to through construction/rehabilitation of one boreholes equipped with hybrid and supplied water to two kiosks through piping system to two kiosks. Extension and construction of water supply systems in IDP camps benefiting 12000 drought affected men, women, girls and boys in Elbarde district. \n2. Construction/ rehabilitation of 12 shallow wells with hand pumps benefiting at least 11000 drought /AWD affected communities in Elbarda district \n3.  To ensure the sustainability and the management of water facilities, HIDIG will ensure to enhance the capacity of WASH committees to keep the maintenance and operation of the water source after the project is faced out.  HIDIG will ensure the maintenance and the appropriate use of water facilities in close coordination and coordination with IDPs mainly camp committees (men and women). \nSanitation :Construct 100 flood proof gender sensitive desludging latrines with hand washing facilities and with inside and outside lockable door to ensure the privacy of women and girls. around men, women and children are equally\n Hygiene promotion activities : HP will carry out comprehensive hygiene and sanitation promotion awareness campaign to promote the adaption of good hygiene and sanitation practices to affected men, women and children. \nSustainability : The rehabilitated  water sources (boreholes) will also serve as the main water supply sources to support neighboring villages with water trucking in the recent dry seasons.ill .The propose WASH investments will help affected communities in accessing sustainable water sources and eventually  reduce the impact of recurrent droughts ,climate shocks and improve their resilience in long run",

According to the FSNAU- FEWS NET- Post Deyr Technical release IN Feb 2019, more than 1.5 million people will face Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or higher) through June 2019 and an additional 3.4 million people are classified as Stressed (IPC 2), which brings the total number of people in Somalia facing acute food insecurity through mid-2019 to 4.9 million. In addition, 903,100 children under the age of five years will likely face acute malnutrition in 2019, including 138,200 who are likely to be severely malnourished. \n\nTension and occasional clashes between Somaliland and Puntland over the contested Sool and Sanaag regions has led to displacement of more than 1000 households to nearby locations. According to reports from Puntland\u2019s Humanitarian Affairs and Disaster Management Agency, the situation remains tense and hostilities could resume anytime. Baidoa district is one of the main hubs for IDPs and presents critical gaps in terms of humanitarian coordination and information as well as service provision. Drought conditions combined with a proliferated conflict with Al Shabab has exacerbated displacement. An estimated 2.6 million people across Somalia remain internally displaced, either scattered among host communities in rural areas or living in formal and informal settlements on the fringes of urban areas. Most of the primary IDP settlements are in Crisis or Stressed in the presence of humanitarian assistance, including Baidoa and Sanaag IDPs. Conditions for IDPs are likely to deteriorate unless humanitarian support is scaled-up. \n\nIn the presented context, through CCCM, ACTED will: Establish, reinforce and strengthen governance, management and coordination mechanisms at appropriate levels Increase site safety through site maintenance and improvement works and Capacity build Camp Governance, CCCM stakeholders and local authorities working towards self-management. ACTED will implement these activities in 42 IDP sites in both Sanaag and Baidoa 39 previously supported IDP sites in Baidoa (ref: SOM-18/3485/SA1/CCCM-WASH-Shelter/INGO/8671) to build on the gains achieved through the SHF integrated support by focusing on capacity building, self-management and handover of activities to communities 3 new IDP sites (Karasharka, Fadhigaab, El-Midgaan) in El-Afweyne district of Sanaag, targeting a largely undeserved area. 6,443 HHs (approximately 38,658 people) in Baidoa and 1,222HHs (approximately 7,332 people) in Sanaag, a total of 7,665HHs will benefit from this intervention, in addition to the community working in these sites including local authorities, clusters and other NGOs. These numbers might vary due to external factors such as the drought, which might attract more IDPs, excessive flooding or conflict with the landowners or the authorities, which may cause IDPs to flee to other areas.",

        "description": "This project seeks towards the strengthening camp coordination and camp management in order to ensure equitable access to services and protection for displaced persons in informal settlements. People displaced to informal sites do not have their basic needs met due to the inconsistent provision of services or exclusion from accessing humanitarian support as a result of poor targeting of sites. This project seeks SHF allocation towards the strengthening camp coordination and camp management in order to ensure equitable access to services and protection for displaced persons in Banadir region. Majority of IDPs in Banadir region settle in informal and unplanned settlements where the conditions are very poor and forced eviction is a common threat, and where newly displaced people join those whose displacement has become protracted. Many are displaced multiple times. CCCM will strengthen the predictability and effectiveness of multi sectorial interventions at site level through continuous mapping of displacement settings, improved community participation and continuous monitoring.\n\nNoFYL is aware of challenges existing around land and property tenure arrangements, including customary access rights to land when selecting sites for the construction of the community centers. Where the land or property is privately held, NoFYL will consult with relevant stakeholders to obtain authorization and a long term formal agreement from owners to ensure long term sustainability of project constructions. \n\nThrough this project, NoFYL will reach 4,203 HHs in 7 IDP settlements with a total target beneficiary of 19,218 in Deynille and Kaxda districts with necessary services through coordination mechanism set in place with relevant stake holders and other partners. Targets in Deynille being the following camps Dayax Centre (550HH), Dheegan Bille (437HH), and Sabriye IDP camps (816HH) while Kaxda the project will target Samawade Camp (500HH), Alanfutow (270HH) Husungow (360HH), Ceel Hareeri (270HH) and Alhidaya IDP camps (1000HH).",

        "description": "This project seeks to enhance the living conditions and access to service for estimated 9,000 IDP households (54,000 persons) in Kaxda and Daynile districts of Benadir. This will be achieved through a number of interrelated and complementary activities including setting up and strengthening of camp governance structures where necessary to enhance information-sharing and foster system-wide coordination among service providers. Key program activities also include construction of temporary, multi-purpose social halls to provide space for improved coordination and effective management of sites. Periodic service mapping and site monitoring will be undertaken in close coordination with the CCCM cluster and other partners to effectively address existing gaps and maximize efficiency of the humanitarian response. \n\nAn integral part of the proposed intervention is to support community led site maintenance activities through cash for work schemes to ensure upkeep of sites. During the course of project duration, AVORD will also distribute a range of tools for effective disaster and solid waste management. Critical site infrastructure including 240 latrines and 40 main gates will be upgraded to minimize protection risks and enhance safety at sites. In the selection of beneficiaries for cash-for-work activities, AVORD will adapt a systematic approach with a clear criterion to prioritize the most vulnerable households including the marginalized, single headed-households, large families and/or families with children under the age of 5, women at risk as identified by protection officers and those with special needs. Data collected to inform beneficiary selection will be segregated by gender to ensure that no group is left-out. List of beneficiaries along with their contact numbers will be availed to SHF and other actors responding in the area to avoid overlap. \n\nThe effectiveness of the aid package will be evaluated through monitoring of activities thus ensuring that beneficiaries access their services safely and in a dignified manner. Protection will be mainstreamed throughout project duration by closely coordinating with other partners operating Sexual and Gender Based Violence (SGBV) crisis centers and facilitating principled referrals where necessary. An elaborate feedback and complain mechanism will be setup to ensure accountability to the affected population.",

        "description": "The education system has suffered widespread loss and damage, resulting in limited capacity and resources.\nAccess to education has reached a historic low, with more than three million children today out of schools in Somalia. The national Gross Enrollment Rate (GER) is 30 per cent for primary education and 26 per cent for secondary level education (HRP 2019 report). \nThe project intends to target 16 IDP sites in Baidoa town. The identified camps are among the 391 IDP camps which were in great majority set up during 2017 and which are home to 47,873 HHs (CCCM report, DSA, March 2019). \nThis project aims to achieve access to education for IDP children by targeting 2,185 out of school children (1,090 boys and 1,095 girls) living inside IDP settlements in Baidoa to ensure their access to school thus enhancing their safety and protection as well as the enjoyment of their rights. Out of the total 2,185 children, 2,060 are primary school age children while 125 are secondary school age children and/or children above 15 years.\nThis project will ensure that emergency and crisis affected children/youth have access to safe and protective learning environments in the partner schools. This will be done through a comprehensive action to respond to immediate and longer term needs of the children. The learners will be provided with access to food, water and scholastic material and children with protection concerns will be supported through strengthening/creating referral mechanisms where necessary, to specialized services. Girl  education will be at the center of the project encompassing all activities and it will be promoted with trainings, advocacy campaigns and community mobilization in support of changing negative attitudes and practices. Adolescent school aged girls will also be provided with sanitary pads in support to improving their attendance rates in classrooms and CECs will be sensitized on the importance of girls\u2019 education during the back to school campaigns. Personal hygiene and sanitation, school personnel and parents\u2019 commitment to provide leadership in promoting girls\u2019 education are proven to be two key factors in improving girls\u2019 attendance rates as recommended by the beneficiaries during FGDs held by INTERSOS staff in the current SHF EiE project implemented din Wajid and Education Cannot Wait project implemented last year in Baidoa. \nThe foreseen construction and rehabilitation of temporary learning spaces will ensure access to a safe and enabling learning environment. Additionally, capacity building will be conducted for CECs and teachers on pedagogy, child protection, child wellbeing and psychosocial support. Teachers will also be supported through payment of monthly incentives corresponding to 100 USD for a period of 8 months. \nAmong the 16 targeted settlements, the 3 IDP camps located within the Horseed urban village called Shimo Tiyeglow, Kalimey and Bohaladi will be provided with two new learning spaces and segregated gender latrines since no education service is present in this area. \nChild protection is mainstreamed into the project. One of the key focus of the project will be indeed to prevent and respond to children with protection concern considering the school as a safe space and an entry point to enhance children\u2019s protective environment. The project will conduct regular analysis of the situation of children regarding causes and patterns of protection concerns and will respond accordingly through prevention and strengthening or creating quick referral pathways, conduct service mapping to facilitate appropriate referrals and strengthen coordination and linkages in service delivery to ensure quality comprehensive services to the children with protection concerns.\n Building communities\u2019 resilience and promoting the reintegration of children in the formal education system. In 2018 INTERSOS already successfully referred and supported 117 children to the public schools Mustafa Sheik and Sahal Moalim.",

The project will be implemented in IDP camps of Galkacayo where thousands of emergencies affected children are denied of their right to basic education due to lack of support and school facilities in their settlements. In conflicts or crises situation, enrollment rates fall, and drop-out increases and children are denied access to education and therefore remain out-of-school. \n\nThe project will adopt an integrated approach to promoting safe, inclusive and quality learning opportunities for the children affected by crisis and provide essential support for students and schools. The support include the construction and rehabilitation of temporary and permanent learning spaces, distribution of school equipment and learning materials, construction of water storage facilities and gender-segregated latrines provision of drinking water delivery of hygiene promotion services and provision of live-saving services such as provision of school meals. \n\nThe project will also give special emphasis on the protection and the well-being of children by establishing and training community child protection committee at schools, training teachers on psychosocial support as well developing and rolling out of community-based child protection mechanism. Besides, referral centers will be mapped and assessed to refer and assist children who required referral for further support. Child protection focal points will be recruited at schools while all schools will have active child to child clubs. The purpose of these activities are to promote the safety and protection of students at schools, make school safe and child-friendly zone and identify and support children with protection and psychosocial support. This will also cultivate a culture that respects child rights and promotes their protection. \n\nThe ultimate aim of the project is to ensure greater access in safe learning environment and improved learning for children affected by emergencies to reduce violence, avoid further marginalization and loss of another generation. \n\nIn order to improve the quality of education, teachers will be trained on child-centered teaching methods and psycho-social support, and given emergency incentives.  Community Education Committees (CECs), local authorities and partners will be trained on psycho-social support skills, emergency preparedness, contingency planning and related issues. The proposed intervention will also improve the education authorities\u2019 and CECs capacity to plan for and respond to education in emergency situations.\n\nThe project will target and support a total of 6750 students, 120 teachers and 140 CEC members.Beneficiaries will be selected through participatory and predetermined selection criteria prioritizing the most affected and needy people and 48% will be girls. Gender will be mainstreamed into the project through the specific consideration of the different needs of women, men, boys and girls during the design of activities. The project will ensure that all participants have equal access to resources and training. Monitoring and evaluation will be based on gender, age and diversity dis-segregated data. \n\nThe project will be directly implemented by NRC in collaboration with Puntland State ministry of Educations and Education clusters. A comprehensive monitoring framework will be developed for the project and information including attendance, drop out will be collected using Kobo toolbox and analyzed and shared.

To ensure water availability in the targeted schools, RI will truck safe water to all 31 schools but CECs will manage its distribution. Further, the CECs will be trained on DRR to build their capacities and improve school preparedness against future disasters. Child- and gender-friendly latrines in the targeted schools will be rehabilitated or, where necessary, constructed to minimize disruptions in learning for girls and boys. RI will coordinate a back-to-school campaign with CECs and religious leaders to encourage school enrollment with an emphasis on children affected by displacement. RI, in collaboration with the appropriate ministries, will map existing referral pathways and service providers and link schools to these services. Where pathways are weak or non-functional, RI will strengthen them to ensure effective response to child protection concerns. To monitor the effectiveness of the child protections systems implemented and capture lessons learned, RI will facilitate joint review workshops with schools, service providers, and relevant government ministries. Through engagement with ministry officials such as MoEampHE Gender Focal Points, Office of Puntland Human Rights Defender and CECs, RI will leverage the respective agency apparatus and community assets to raise awareness among children on child protection and the established referral mechanisms which will serve to strengthen child protection in schools and the larger communities.",

The proposed intervention is guided by FSNAU seasonal analysis (Feb 2, 2019) and a needs assessment undertaken by ActionAid in February 2019 which concluded food, water and protection as priority needs in the target IDP camps. The planned intervention will further address the negative coping mechanisms that the displaced communities have resorted to due to the inadequacy of the current responses. \n\nActionAid uses the humanitarian crisis as an opportunity to shift power imbalance and puts in place women-led humanitarian response. Guided by ActionAid Humanitarian signature anchored on Human Rights Based Approach, the proposed programme will ensure women\u2019s leadership in the key aspects of the response. In collaboration with camp management, women groups will be empowered to lead selection and validation of the beneficiaries, distribute Quick Response (QR) cards and manage complaints through establishment of complaint desk at each distribution sites. \n\nActionAid liaises with humanitarian actors at camp management level, attend coordination meetings at district, sub-national and national levels. Among the coordination platforms that ActionAid attends include Food Security and protection clusters, Cash and GBV working groups and general humanitarian coordination meetings. ActionAid will specifically liaise with the humanitarian actors that have plans for the population in the Burco IDP camps. to avoid overlaps and duplication of efforts. Moreover, ActionAid will regularly update 5W matrix and share through UNOCHA and other existing platforms.\n\nThe proposed intervention fits well with the integrated allocation strategy for food security \u201cto prevent deterioration from crisis (IPC3) to emergency (IPC4) \u2013 reduce food consumption gap \u2026).

The accumulated figure reflect 90% of the total burden of the target districts based on 2019 nutrition cluster burden estimates as well as the projected figures for the first half of the year 2020. \n\nANPPCANSOM will maintain treatment outcomes consistent with Sphere standards using the combined protocol for the management of acute malnutrition in close consultation and coordination with Somali Nutrition Cluster, Somaliland Nutrition Working Group and other nutrition partners including MOHD, UNICEF and WFP. ANPPCANSOM will build on and sustain the delivery of a holistic basic nutrition services package (BNSP) in priority to internally displaced people and their host communities and other socially marginalized groups in pastoral and hard to reach areas while ensuring the inclusion of treatment, promotion and prevention components in this project.\n\nThe project will provide facility-based and community based (BNSP) covering both curative and preventative interventions targeting children U5 years (boys and girls) and pregnant and lactating women. It will support the identification, referral and treatment of children suffering from severe acute malnutrition while SAM cases with medical complications will be referred to the nearest stabilization centers using standard referral forms. ANPPCANSOM will manage 22 fixed OTP sites and 2 stabilization centres (6 OTP fixed sites for Zeila district 9 fixed OTP sites and 1 SC for Berbera district, 6 fixed OTP sites for Hargeisa district 1 fixed OTP and 1 SC for Gabiley district). Efforts will be made to ensure integration of OTP and TSFP sites where possible.  In order to ensure the sustainability of nutrition interventions, local technical capacity will be strengthened by integrating SAM management into the Primary Health Care system through the functional MCH facilities. Additionally, the capacity of nutrition staff will be strengthened for effective service delivery at facility and community level. \n\nIn addition, the project will support community mobilization and screening as well as micro-nutrient supplementation for PLW (multiple micro-nutrients and Iron folate) and Vitamin A supplementation for children between 6-59 months. It will also provide de-worming for children 12-59 months and pregnant women in the 2nd and 3rd trimester as well as counselling and promotion on infant and young child feeding compounded with health and hygiene promotion. Moreover, measles immunization will be provided to infants living within the catchment areas of the target health centers who are not immunized against measles. Systematic defaulter tracing for immunization services will also be conducted at community level. In order to strengthen the accountability with affected population, we will introduce mother-led MUAC approach to increase detection, identification and early referral of malnourished children. ANPPCANSOM will train mothers to use MUAC tapes to enable mothers screen, detect oedema and self-referral of their children to nutrition sites.",

The key focus of the project will be providing Case management services for UASC through immediate care, referrals and family tracing and response to GBV survivors. The project will establish referral system in schools and support community-based Child Protection Mechanisms for quick and efficient referrals of children with protection needs through service mapping within the community and in the schools (community child protection committees, School Management Committees) This project also strengthens service mapping to facilitate appropriate referrals, coordination and linkage in service delivery to ensure quality comprehensive services to unaccompanied and separated children (UASC), children at risk of being recruited by armed forces or armed groups (CAAFAG) and gender based violence (GBV) survivors. The project will further improve prevention and response to separation of children from their families through family tracing and reunification activities and provision of comprehensive case management and psycho-social support (PSS), including emergency care, referral to INTERSOS medical teams trained in clinical management of rape (CMR), access tailored material assistance, and follow up on the services for gender based violence survivors. Capacity building of CPWG to strengthen and improve identification of cases and increase their knowledge on child protection minimum standards will also be provided. The project will Mainstream child protection and GBV to other service providers to ensure compassionate, confidential, and competent action for children and women in emergencies. \nINTERSOS will conduct GBV and CP community mobilization campaign to improve access to response services for protection affected targeted communities. Awareness will focus on rights of children and men and women, roles and responsibilities of children, causes and consequence of separation as well as consequences of the incidences of gender based violence, Mine risk education, identification and reporting unaccompanied and separated children (UASC) and GBV survivors, services available for Gender Based violence survivors and unaccompanied and separated (UASC), as well as appropriate referrals in place in the target location.

        "title": "COVID-19 Emergency Response in Somalia",
        "description": "The key objective is to implement preventative measures for vulnerable groups that have limited access to COVID-19 prevention and response actions. This is to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in urban IDP settings. The intervention will focus on the most vulnerable groups: older people \u2013 forming approximately 2.7 per cent of the population and the urban poor and IDPs about 75% of the population. Assessments shows these as most vulnerable who are heavily impacted by COVID-19 infection. For this response, IRS seeks to complement the efforts of the government and other humanitarian organisation in Somalia by reaching approximately 40,000 beneficiaries directly and up to 200,000 indirectly.\n1. Risk communication and community engagement. The proposed project will support preventative measures to combat the spread of COVID 19. This will include extensive awareness initiatives using multiple media channels to support preventative action of the government and communities. The information/ education and communication is designed to reach the population  through print, audio-visual media messages, SMS and community mobilisation using religious/community/group leaders and elders. Display monitors on COVID 19 risks and prevention in local language will be installed at strategic locations such as roundabouts, airports and community centres in IDP camps.\n2.  Health: Strengthen existing health facilities in the selected IDP camps to combat COVID 19 infection. The proposed project will provide 18 PPE kits to seven health facilities in the seven IDP camps and the three designated COVID 19 referral hospitals. The proposed project will also set up and equip 11 COVID 19 screening centres in the to do surveillance and early detection at the primary health care centres in the IDP camps, provide cleaning and sterilising equipment and supplies to these facilities to limit hospital infections.\n3. WASH: Reduce the spread of COVID 19 and decrease morbidity and mortality in the selected districts. The project improve hygiene practices, limiting infection IDP camps.24 hand-washing stations will be built in the IDP camps in Bondhere, Baidoa, Balcad, Gardho and Burtinle. Hygiene kits, containing bath soap, laundry soap, 2 jerry cans, and facemask, will be supplied to 3500 households. Special consideration will be given to female headed household and PWD. \n4. Livelihood: Improving livelihoods through unconditional cash transfer of USD 70 for 3 months to 333 households, and USD 70 cash assistance for 2 months to 333 households as livelihoods support. The beneficiaries will be selected using robust selection criteria that targets the most vulnerable and prioritise female headed household. The UCT will be done using mobile money transfer which has the benefit of increased security, convenience, privacy, speed, reduced operational/transaction costs and logistics for the beneficiaries and for Islamic relief. Somalia has large mobile network reach. The choice of money gives the beneficiaries the widest range of transactional capabilities and broad access to basic financial services (such as deposit, withdrawal, person-to-person transfers and e-money transactions with registered traders of goods and service providers). Islamic Relief used mobile money in drought/ flood emergency programme (including WFP Baxnaano programme). The lessons from previous experience which guide the choice of UCT include: \n-  Beneficiaries purchase a more diverse set of goods, had higher dietary diversity,\n- Beneficiaries depleted fewer assets and grew more types of crops, especially marginal cash crops grown by women.  They are able to o restock livelihood assets faster. The reasons for this can be attributed to the lower costs and greater privacy of receiving a cash transfer via the mobile transfer, as well as changes in intra-household decision-making.\n5. Establish complaint management and feedback mechanism to the affected population. Through this intervention, IR MEAL unit will ensure that project delivers responses as designed to the affected population. Through an established mechanism of complaints mechanism and feedback channels, the affected population will be made to understand and demand their rights until all is provided to their satisfaction. \n6. Build and establish DRR community champions for covid-19 preparedness, response and treatment. The established committee is trained on covid-19 risk reduction management. Their role is to ensure that community members are made aware of the impact of covid-19, where to seek treatment and how to enforce containment measures such as social distancing and use of mask and sanitisers as part of exposure reduction. \nIRS will lead the implementation. The project will build on existing IRS interventions in health WASH and livelihood sectors and maximise the impact and sustainability",

        "description": "Apart from the other layers of hazards existing in the target areas, COVID-19 had also impacted small scale farmers. It has been reported many farmers have abandoned their farming and sought an alternative source of income from the nearby towns. This has increased and exposed the farmers to the risk of COVID 19. \nA.\tFood security of poor farmers through revitalizing agricultural production in the targeted areas. Through cash for work, irrigation canal will be rehabilitated, and farm inputs will be supplied.  The rehabilitation work will be on excavating (desilting) of flood damaged canals.  This will improve the accessibility and availability of water for irrigation uses. Two canals with dimension of 2m width and 1m depth and 2km length will be rehabilitated. Each canal will provide water to 10 farms. In addition to this, the farmers will receive an improved seed such as maize, sesame, tomatoes and pumpkins.  Availing water and seeds to farmers will improve their farm activities and reduce the risk of seeking labour to unsafe environments. In doing this the farmers will start producing by themselves and subsequently able to both feed their families and sell their produce. The project will link to farmers to the existing potential markets through establishing a network between agriculture traders and target farmer groups.  This activity will be done for 15 days by 200 farmers at a rate of $5 per day. Each farm will be distributed with farm equipment\u2019s worth $200\n\nB.\tIncreased employment opportunity through VSLA and income generating activities:  As COVID 19 had mostly impacted poor and vulnerable people who were dependent on market activities such as labour, aid and family support. In the first phase, the project had transferred cash to maintain the minimum food basket for target households.  The cash had supported families to sustain their livelihoods in specific periods of the project. In order to move to an early socio-economic recovery, on the second phase, the project intends to transition from short term cash transfer to more sustainable income generating activities.  The project will introduce a village, saving and loans association approach (VSLA) to improve access to financial resources for poor households, targeting women in priority. The primary purpose of a VSLA is to provide simple savings and loan facilities and through these and other enabling activities empower women to manage resources and invest them for the benefit of their household. Loans can provide a form of self- insurance to members, supplemented by a saving fund which provides small but important income to members in distress. The VSLA system enables members of a self-selected group to voluntarily save money through purchasing shares. The savings are then invested in a loan fund from which members can borrow as well as meet their immediate needs such as food, water and health care or make further investments to diversify and increase their incomes. The project will support 15 VSLA groups of 15 \u2013 20 members with initial seed fund of 3000 USD for each group. The activity will start with community mobilization, selection of households to participate and group formation. While the methodology is simple, it depends on a very carefully structured system of training. Over seven sessions, groups learn to: form their associations; define a purpose; elect officials; design their system of savings, insurance and credit; and practice running savings and credit meetings. Once this process is completed, VSLAs can begin to save and to lend. They are supervised over a period of 12 months by field staffs who ensure procedures and systems work properly and that the groups can function independently thereafter;\n\nC.\tHealth: Strengthened capacity of existing health facilities and services to combat Covid-19. The proposed project will provide 18 PPE kits to 3 health facilities in the seven IDP camps and the three designated COVID 19 referral hospitals. The proposed project will equip 11 COVID 19 screening centres in the to do surveillance and early detection at the primary health care centres in the IDP camps, provide cleaning and sterilising equipment and supplies to these facilities to limit hospital infections. Other activities also include procurement of medicines, community mobilization outreach and training of frontline health workers. IR will also work with the government hospitals and other unit of covid-19 task force in the preparation of covid roll-out. IR will support through advocacy and media outreach for people to accept and take the vaccines. This approach of advocacy, lobbying through media and electronic information sharing will enable the roll-out of vaccines. IR will also use its health facilities as centre for passing information to patients and their dependents to take up vaccines once its made available. Similarly, IR will by making available a vehicle and a driver support the ministry of health with logistics mainly in Balaad, Baidoa and Bandar districts.\n\nD.\tWASH: The project will expand water points in IDPs. In some IPDs for instance Dayniile district, the accessibility of water stands for handwashing is still very small. The water point will allow beneficiaries to easily access water points for handwashing in their proximity.  The expansion will include laying out of pipes and construction of fenced water points. The expansion will improve the sanitation and hygiene of IDP communities so that they can prevent from themselves the spread of COVID 19 pandemic. The water points will be placed in strategic position such as schools and health centres. Additionally, IR will construct water tanks, piping system, training of water committee with a view to make water available for covid-19 prevention. \n\nE.\tProtection: Since there is a prevailing reports of incidence of gender based violence, early marriage, the project will carry out an awareness sessions including training of women and men. These sessions will be in line with Islamic Relief Somalia safeguarding and protection principles.",

        "description": "EGEP-T aims to increase girls\u2019 learning in numeracy, literacy and life skills, whilst supporting them through key transition points in education and beyond to improved life opportunities. The project will also be developing community and institutional capacity to ensure support to girls\u2019 education is sustained in the longer term. EGEP saw significant progress regarding community members\u2019 expectations of girls about girls\u2019 education between baseline and midline. General support for girls\u2019 education increased by 27% across community members surveyed and the percentage of caregivers stating gender to be an important factor determining whether a child should go to school declined from 54% to 9%. Respondents frequently noted that community members themselves are engaging in awareness-raising activities. School enrolment increased by 20% and attendance increased by 5%, which suggests this positive shift in attitudes has led to positive results in school. Learning levels increased, however, they did not reach the intended targets. 37% of girls who enter secondary school have dropped out by Form 4. A contributing factor behind these less positive trends appears to be that the aspirations of caregivers and communities for girls\u2019 education can be at odds with the considerable expectations placed on girls in terms of traditionally assigned gender roles. EGEP conducted 70 FGDs with girls, asking them what the most critical challenges were that lead to girls\u2019 decreased participation in school in later grades: after economic factors, the most common response was early marriage, and the third most common response was household chores. Additionally, girls are often expected to prioritise care of siblings or contribution to household income over schooling and homework. These expectations intensify as the girl reaches adolescence. Furthermore, within the school, girls are not necessarily expected to achieve at the same level as boys, to hold leadership positions, and to complete the full education cycle. The table below provides examples of severely marginalised groups of girls the project will target, the current expectations for these groups and how they differ from what the project intends to achieve:",

To date, the country remains divided by various political and clan factions and strong anti-governement elements who are benefiting from the availability remnants or war (ERW) such as landmines and unexploded ordinance (UXO) thereby significantly weakening the overall stability and security in Somalia. This project seeks to reduce the impact of landmines, unsecured ammunition stockpiles, UXO and other ERW have at regional level. Phase one will target Northern Somalia (Somaliland) where large clearance efforts are coming to an end in the next three years and where, until clerarance is completed, accidents will continue to affect rural communities. HALO will deploy four manual clerance teams and one mechanical team to clear 616,000m2 from 1 Setember 2016 to 31 December 2018. Phase two will take place in Southern Somalia where government credibility has been gradualy increasing and where making concrete steps to restore stability can significantly foster state's legitimacy. International funding for HMA in Somalia is contributing to the multilateral effort to stabilise Southern Somalia by addressing factors leading Somali populations to migrate to Europe in search of better futures. HALO\u2019s work in Southern Somalia began in 2015, and a process of slow, steady development is being undertaken to minimize risks to the programme.",

        "description": "Some 1.5 billion people, half of the world\u2019s poor, live in fragile settings where the government is unable or unwilling to fulfill its core responsibilities to protect and care for its citizens. In such fragile settings, often characterized by variable levels of violent conflict, perspectives for stability and sustainable inclusive development - key priorities of the Dutch Government - continue to be extremely bleak. Whereas each fragile setting is unique, a broad international consensus exists on the multiple and complex causes that need to be addressed for a transition out of fragility. Among these, establishing inclusive governance processes is considered essential. A key obstacle for achieving stability and sustainable development in fragile settings is the structural exclusion of segments of society from local, district level and national governance processes. Our theory of change (TOC) addresses this with a focus on inclusive governance processes, referring to the extent to which governance processes provide space to overcome the systematic exclusion of disadvantaged groups seeking to participate in decision making. Therefore this strategic partnership\u2019s overall objective is to contribute to inclusive and effective governance processes in fragile settings. Specific target and impact groups may vary country by country and will be determined on the basis of thorough analysis and consultation with relevant stakeholders. The inclusion of women in governance processes is key to stability and development in all countries and therefore crosscuts all program interventions.",

        "description": "Quality of content produced by Somalian media is in general of a very low quality. Most people working in the media learned by doing without a proper journalistic education. Media outlets often lack a proper business model and editorial policies. To some extent this leads to envelope journalism (taking money to make stories without fact checking), and biased reporting. A lack of capacity to develop diverse broadcast and content formats allowing for meaningful interaction with audiences, is apparent in nearly all media outlets. Content often consists of long monologues or interviews, with no real programmes on social issues. Items often cover leading (political) figures, conferences or meetings and no personal stories or citizen accounts. Journalists often do not cover social issues and are unaware of their potential for agenda setting. Women are underrepresented in the Somali media. Gender inequalities are evident in media ownership, decision-making in media houses and in media content. Somali civil society organisations and women's organisations are not used to collaborate with the media to set the agenda and influence Somali authorities in development of laws and policies. The involvement of Civil Society Organisations in the public debate is limited and they play a modest role in lobby and advocacy. Safety is another important issue. According to the annual report of the National Union of Somali Journalists (NUSOJ), the grim toll for 2014 was as follows: five media workers murdered in Mogadishu, Galkayo and Baidoa; five journalists injured; 47 journalists arrested; five media houses attacked. With these figures Somalia is one of the most dangerous places on earth for journalists. Media associations such as Somaliland Journalist Association (SOLJA) and NUSOJ were not yet capable of implementing a self-regulatory framework. Associations of Somali journalists are under developed. The media law that foresees amongst others the set- up of a regulatory body has not been approved or implemented yet. By consequence no regulatory body that holds unethical media stations accountable is operational.",

        "description": "This project aims at restoring stable communities in Somalia through establishing local structures that research, identify, analyse, prioritize and implement solutions to community security issues, in collaboration with local authorities, formal security actors and civil society. At the state level, it will re-establish bodies that promote community-responsive policing, acting as a link through which information on security provision is channelled, and form bridges between local, state and national levels. Learning and insights from all levels will be fed upwards through national-level civil society networks, promoting community-focused security provision at national and international level. The objectives of the programme are to strengthen the capacity of local civil society groups and communities to research and facilitate broad dialogue across clan and state-society divides about local security issues, provide resources for implementation of joint conflict prevention and community security initiatives, support cross-regional community exchange to share experiences and common security problems, link community members with existing dispute resolution mechanisms, support the re-introduction and development of regional oversight mechanisms such as police accountability committees with channels for community input, provide training on accountability, gender- and conflict-sensitivity, link these bodies into a cross-regional learning network, facilitate their engagement in policy dialogue at the federal member state level, conduct policy discourse with the Somali federal government, regional bodies and international actors to communicate evidence about inclusive approaches to improving human security, and facilitate dialogue among policy-makers at the national level and communities. This will eventually result in a reduction in inter and intra-clan division and violence, more inclusive, responsive and accountable security provision including effective mechanisms to prevent misuse of power and improve coordination, greater coherence in policy formation between Federal regions, and more evidence-based policy and programming on human security from international actors.",

To achieve this the project supports the capacity of public sector institutions to provide quality health services. Three out\nputs have been defined:1.) Local health professionals have skills/capacity to deliver quality health services2.) Local health training institutions have improved competence and ability to train local health professionals 3.) Ministry of Health has increase\nd capacity to steer manage and coordinate the health sector The Somali diaspora experts particularly the Finnish Somali diaspora experts are the actors in the capacity building efforts. They train the local health professionals and participate in developin\ng strategies plans standards and curricula for health sector. Particular attention is given to women's and child health. In the long term the project is expected to contribute to better health outcomes for Somaliland population and especially the health ou\ntcomes for women and children.The first Finnish funded MIDA project was initiated already in 2008. The project has been evaluated twice and the findings suggest that the project has significantly strengthened public health institutions? ability to provide \nquality services in Somaliland. The findings and recommendations of evaluations have been duly notified in the planning of the Finnsom IV phase: For example the project now focuses on the more remote regions in Somaliland where service provision is poorer \nthan in the capital Hargeisa. Similarly following the recommendations the length of the assignments of diaspora experts has been increased for Phase IV.To support the implementation of the project the National Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) also im\nplements tailored trainings for the Ministry of Health.The duration of the Phase IV is four years from March 2017 until February 2021. The budget for the project is 4 300 000 Euros. Somalia is considered an LDC country.",

Second HALO will seek and destroy community held or abandoned stockpiles of ammunition held outside of state control across their area of operations in Souther\nn Somalia.

        "description": "Support to the UN Population Fund's (UNFPA) country programme continues Finland's strong contribution for the development of Somalia's reproductive maternal and child health care services. UNFPA has been among the three UN agencies that have been involved \nin the UN Joint Nutrition and Health Programme in Somalia (JHNP) which focused on the development of maternal and child health services. Finland supported the implementation of the programme for 15.5MEUR between 2014-2016. JHNP has provided services for an\n area covering half of Somalia's population. It has reached good results having significantly contributed to the reduction of maternal and infant mortality. Through JHNP UNFPA has supported the provision of maternal sexual and reproductive health services \nas well as contributed to improving their quality. UNFPA has supported the running of 135 maternal clinics; the training of midwifes in 15 midwiferies throughout Somalia; the provision of training on reproductive health for over 600 health care professiona\nls; as well as the provision of technical assistance to the ministries of health to support their capacity building including their work on health sector strategic development. As JHNP is coming to an end in early-2017 UNFPA continues the work to develop t\nhe reproductive maternal and child health care in Somalia according to its mandate.UNFPA country strategy for Somalia for 2011-2016 has been extended for one year to cover also 2017. Its overall objective is to improve the wellbeing of Somali people. The c\nountry strategy aims to achieve this through reducing maternal mortality and through supporting the realization of reproductive rights and services. In addition the strategy supports gender equality and combats gender-based violence as well as strengthens \nthe Somali statistical systems and promotes evidence-based planning and policy design.Three particular priority areas have been identified for 2017:1.Increased provision of comprehensive sexual and reproductive health services (around 50% of the annual bud\nget for 2017)2.Promotion of gender equality and prevention of gender-based violence (around 25% of the 2017 budget)3.Strengthened national capacity on use of quality disaggregated data for evidence-based planning and policy design on population and develop\nment issues (around 25% of the 2017 budget)Finland supports the implementation of the UNFPA Somalia country strategy for 2011-2017 for 2 million euros.",

For four years, Clingendael Academy would extend its negotiation training offer to the humanitarian sector to increase its capacity to provide humanitarian assistance to those in need. After a few months of preparation, the first training was delivered in July 2017 in The Hague with especially created negotiation simulations and interactive exercises. In 2018, Clingendael Academy saw this programme really take off within the sector with ever increasing numbers of applications for our training courses, at times with three applications per available spot.

        "description": "This Program Document proposes a Reengagement and Reform Development Policy Financing (DPF) for the Federal Republic of Somalia in the amount of US dollar 420 million from International Development Association (IDA) grant resources. The objectives of the proposed DPF are to facilitate full normalization of relations with the World Bank Group (WBG) and support Somalia's economic recovery through policy reforms that strengthen fiscal management and promote inclusive private sector-led growth. Up to SDR 271.2 (up to US dollar 375 million equivalent) of the proposed grant will be disbursed to the bridge-loan creditor assisting with arrears clearance (\u2018Portion A of the Financing\u2019); and SDR 32.6 million (US dollar 45 million equivalent) will be disbursed to the Federal Government of Somalia (FGS) as budget support to meet cash flow needs after Somalia has cleared its arrears to IDA (\u2018Portion B of the Financing\u2019). The DPF complements a rapidly expanding engagement to build human capital and strengthen resilience to climate change and other shocks. In FY2020, the World Bank is currently delivering technical assistance to develop livestock insurance, a major Urbanization Review, and upstream analysis on health and education that are expected to inform new financing. The DPF also addresses the above challenges by enabling full reengagement with the WBG. The DPF will facilitate Somalia's clearance of arrears to IDA, which is a requirement to qualify for international debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. Full reengagement with the international community through the HIPC process is expected to enable Somalia to access the financial and technical support the country needs for sustained poverty reduction and inclusive economic growth. Normalization of Somalia's relationship with IDA would give the government's access to financing from IDA's Crisi",

        "title": "Desert Locusts Joint Response - Lead",
        "description": "The current locust crisis in the Horn of Africa is the worst outbreak of locusts in over 25 years in Ethiopia and Somalia and the worst observed in over 70 years in Kenya. The situation rapidly deteriorated in January 2020 as weather conditions have been unusually conducive to the spread of the pest. These conditions will allow breeding until June 2020 and could lead to 500 times more locusts, with the formation of large numbers of swarms. Desert locusts are expected to continue to breed and spread during the coming months. Given their life cycle, the March-April start of the long rains, coinciding with a regeneration of rangeland and the start of planting activities, will enable a new wave of breeding and further spread of the pest. Desert locusts have already reached northern Uganda, and looking forward, the infestation could: 1) spread further into the Rift Valley (especially in Ethiopia), as well as to South Sudan, 2) affect the 2020 main and secondary staple cropping seasons, and 3) continue to affect rangeland across the region. The desert locust is considered the most destructive migratory pest in the world as it is highly mobile and feeds on large quantities of any kind of green vegetation, including crops, pasture and fodder. A typical swarm can be made up of 150 million locusts per square kilometre and is carried on the wind, up to 150 km in one day. Even a very small, 1 km2 locust swarm (approx. 40 million desert locusts) can eat the same amount of food in one day as about 35 000 people. This can be especially devastating in areas where food security is poor and, where every gram of food produced counts towards minimizing gaps in a family\u2019s food consumption. Currently, the region faces widespread food insecurity. In Ethiopia, an estimated 8.5 million people are severely food insecure, Phase 3 and above, according to IPC between February and June 2020. In Somalia, from February to September 2020, the population in IPC Phases 3 (Crisis) and 4 (Emergency) is expected to rise by 40 percent, from 1.1 million to 1.6 million people. Drivers of this food insecurity include climate shocks, conflict, and macroeconomic crises. Ethiopia has been responding to the current swarm invasions since July 2019. To date, hopper bands have covered more than 429 km\u00b2 of the country. Two generations of breeding have caused large numbers of swarms to form and move to Kenya and Somalia. In January 2020, the swarms were also seen moving towards the Rift Valley in Ethiopia and Kenya\u2019s breadbasket. This would pose a serious threat, especially as Ethiopia already has an estimated 8.5 million people facing severe food insecurity. In Somalia, where 6.7 million people are now regarded as acutely food insecure (IPC Phase 2 and above), swarms bred in the north of the country and have moved mainly to central and southern regions. The pest is affecting pasture and threatening staple food crops in rural areas. Insecurity and a lack of national capacity have hampered control operations. The Somalia Food Security Cluster showed their findings in a presentation; the number of people affected was shown as over 2.5 million (21% of Somalia\u2019s population) and especially pastoralist, agro-pastoralist, riverine and IDPs are affected. COVID-19 In light of the global pandemic of COVID-19, on 25 March 2020, the United Nations launched a USD 2 billion Global Humanitarian Response Plan (GHRP). On 3 February, WHO also launched a Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan (SPRP). The following responses, corresponding with a locust crisis response, must be accelerated or scaled up to achieve Strategic Priorities 2 and 3 of the Covid-19 HRP: - Food and nutrition assistance as well as rural livelihood support to food-insecure and malnourished people vulnerable to the infection particularly in countries experiencing food crises. - Scale-up of social assistance systems, and cash transfer programmes with complementary livelihood assistance (including adaptations for remote digital trade/marketing), particularly for rural crop and livestock workers and producers, small/medium businesses, refugees, IDPs, migrants and host populations, and other food-insecure population groups. The Somalia section of the Covid-19 HRP mentions under the most affected and at-risk population groups that the pandemic could also heavily impact vulnerable communities living in areas dealing with food insecurity and desert locusts, while Ethiopia section mentions that COVID-19 response will undermine efforts to combat desert locust infestations. While people\u2019s lives are threatened by the COVID-19 outbreak, the upcoming two agricultural production seasons are threatened by desert locust infestations. The number of COVID-19 cases reported in both Somalia (237) and Ethiopia (111) as of 20-04-2020 is still relatively low (also due to underreporting). Yet, the countries follow government restrictions and the response is designed with integrated COVID-10 measures.",

To this end, an Insider Peacebuilders Network of committed individuals from civil society will be founded and empowered to carry out mediation, dialogue and other peace-related work on the ground. Furthermore, workshops with regional administration actors will be held to increase their awareness of issues related to peace and conflict, including the impact of climate change on conflict, and build their capacity to respond to conflict. Moreover, large community dialogue assemblies will be organized in various districts across the state at which community members can discuss local conflict and other pertinent issues and develop solutions for these conflicts together. A regional radio program will be produced 1-2 times each month in which topics of peace and conflicts are discussed in various formats and listeners can actively participate. Lastly, recognition of the climate crisis and its impact on conflict and peace and support for the development of ideas for how to address/reduce the impact of climate change will be mainstreamed into all project activities.",

        "title": "Sustainable Access to clean Water,Hygiene and Sanitation to droughts affected communities in Sanaag and Sool region",
        "description": "Sanaag and Sool regions have been facing both acute and chronic water shortages for many years. The prolonged droughts experienced in 2016/2017 have seriously affected the local communities and the water facilities too. The traditional water facilities, such as shallow wells, water pans, dams frequently dry out and there are very few boreholes-which frequently breakdown due to high demand and overuse. Badhan for instance, has a high population (89,435 people) in Eastern Sanaag, and is an old town with no permanent water sources. During the dry period, people trek more than 100km to the nearest water points, while the water prices unreasonably increase to more than 300% (Adeso internal reports). Qawlo under Taleex has similar water needs as Badhan, with an estimated population of 73,529 (UNPFA 2014 data). These 2 locations (Badhan and Qawlo) are highly populated with large rural and [pastoral population and they frequently face water shortages.  \nAdeso propose to drill and equip strategic boreholes in these 2 main centers with adequate water distribution system. The project will be implemented together with the private sector, community and the government to ensure contributions from all stakeholders, the ownership and foreseeable sustainability. Our strategy is to encourage a participatory process with the key stakeholders being involved, develop local ownership and strengthen governance structure for such response. Adeso will enhance this strategy to enable value for money and high impact for this project.  The community and the private sector will contribute 20% of the total cost of Badhan borehole (that is equivalent to $40,000).\nThe drilling and equipping will be done through a competent local contractor, thoroughly vetted by the community, the government and Adeso technical team. Adeso will hire a water engineer, fully dedicated for this project and ensure the expected standards are met. The same contractor will do the hydro-geological survey, identify the best aquifer, present report for deliberation before moving to the actual drilling.  Adeso has strong experience in Somalia and combining hydro-geological survey and drilling into one contract will ensure smooth operation and that the contractor meets the expectation as per the contract.  Adeso will carry out, through its WASH team, an environmental and social impact analysis that may come as a result of the new borehole and apply the necessary mitigation measures in good time.  The proposed boreholes will have several distribution systems, including different water points for the livestock to avoid water contamination. \nThe project will also construct latrines for the poor households, hygiene and sanitation awareness as well as strengthening the water governance structures. The ministries of water, both from Somaliland side for Talex / Qawlo site and Puntland side for Badhan will be involved to ensure the government support and also the response meet the government vision of providing adequate water to the people. \nA water ground breaking analysis will be done to determine the chemical, mineral and the biological analysis of the water.  This will be done as soon as the ground water is hit before any further work is done. The region has a history of salinity and great care needs to be taken with this, so if one aquifer fails or becomes saline, then the contractor moves to another site until the best water quality is achieved. \nAdeso is currently implementing an OFDA funded WASH project in these regions, that has mainly rehabilitation of the rural water facilities-such as shallow wells, boreholes, water pans with hygiene and sanitation components. A climate change adaption project is also being implemented in building community resilience to shocks / adaptation. Adeso recently concluded a 5 year EU Natural resource management program. These interventions provide strong complementarity to the proposed response that will result in high impact.",

        "description": "The humanitarian situation in Northern Somalia in 2018 remains fragile due to residual impact of drought, Cyclone Sagar, conflict and ongoing displacement. While the risk of famine has reduced, humanitarian needs remain high, with extreme water and pasture shortages reported in rainfall deficit areas of Bari, Nugaal, Sool and Sanaag regions. Water scarcity in Sool and Sanaag regions has reached a precarious level, affecting the health of the most vulnerable people and causing occasional resource-based clan conflicts. With only a third of the population having access to improved sanitation, poor hygiene practices (including frequent open defecation) are prevalent, contributing to incidences of water-borne diseases. Consequently, there is an urgent need to improve WASH service delivery at district level. \n\nIn this context, ACTED will implement a WASH cluster-specific intervention aiming to 1) Provide reliable and sustained access to sufficient safe water, based on identified strategic water points 2) Establish an appropriate system for the management and maintenance of facilities, with different groups contributing equitably and 3) Enhance community sanitation and hygiene awareness. \n\nACTED will implement these activities in Taleex district of Sool region, and Erigavo and Dararweyne districts of Sanaag region, targeting a highly vulnerable and largely undeserved area. Approximately 15,000 people (2,500 households) will benefit from this intervention, in addition to creating synergies for improved coordination among WASH stakeholders in the area, including local authorities, clusters and other NGOs. These numbers might vary due to external factors such as the drought, which might attract more IDPs, or escalation of conflict, which may cause communities to flee to other areas.",

Education specific activities will include the provision of education supplies, emergency take-away food rations for students to meet their food and energy needs and emergency teacher incentives to motivate teachers to stay in the schools. Specific WASH activities will include increasing schools\u2019 water storage capacity through the provision of PVC storage tanks, the construction and rehabilitation of latrines, and improving hygiene practices among children through engagement with school hygiene promoters. As hygiene promoters will interact closely with students during hygiene promotion sessions and recreational activities, CISP will train this cadre on hygiene promotion, psycho-social support (PSS), and child protection and safeguarding. Specific Protection activities will include the mapping and sharing of existing child protection service providers and their respective services to school administrators and communities, strengthening child protection systems in schools, including the recruitment and training of child protection focal persons at each school, and awareness raising and training of community education committees (CEC) on child protection. CISP will also continue to engage with Ministry of Education Culture and Higher Education (MoECHE) and train cluster partners and MoE staffs on safe schools contingency planning, DRR and emergency response. CISP will provide training to CECs on their roles and responsibilities, food and water management, disaster risk reduction (DRR), civic skills, proposal development, and child protection in the respective schools. To ensure water availability in targeted schools, CISP will provide cash grants to CECs. In return, CECs will contribute in-kind or cash to procure safe water and manage its distribution to students. Further, the CECs will be trained on DRR to build their capacity and improve school preparedness against armed attack and other natural disasters. Disability and gender-friendly latrines in the targeted schools will be rehabilitated or, where necessary, constructed to minimize disruptions in learning for girls and boys. CISP will coordinate enrollment drives through MoE and with CECs and religious leaders to encourage school enrollment with an emphasis on children affected by displacement. CISP education department will utilize the existing synergies with CISP protection department to assess the existing child protection mechanisms at the start of the project, and, as determined from the assessment results, targeted schools will develop appropriate action plans to address areas of concern. To measure the effectiveness of the child protections systems implemented and capture lessons learned, CISP will conduct an end line assessment. Through the CISP protection department engagement with CEC\u2019s and the regional Gender Focal Points (GFP\u2019s) of MoE, CISP will leverage the agency's apparatus and community assets to raise awareness among children on child protection and the established mechanisms which will serve to strengthen child protection in schools.",

Participation of the community groups such as women, youth, and local leaders will be prioritized so as to enhance and get more feedback as an aspect of accountability to the affected population. RRP will do monthly, quarterly, midyear and end year reporting. RRP will work towards reduction of the high prevalence of SAM and MAM in the district. hence reducing mortality and morbidity rates related to malnutrition and improve, provide and integrated, nutrition related resilience interventions lifesaving and quality nutrition services to acutely malnourished children and PLWs through community based nutritional service. Increase access and utilization of BNSP, MCH services to acutely malnourished boys\u2019 girls U5, and PLW and integrate WASH services. Capacity building to the community health workers, volunteers, care givers and field staff and strengthen the existing community-based nutrition service structures to provide comprehensive basic nutritional service packages (BNSP) to malnourished children U5 and PLW in the two districts. The lack of essential WASH services means serious public health risks and preventable deaths. \nThe project shall promote the equitable participation of both men and women in the planning and decision-making processes, this will ultimately help to ensure that the entire affected population has safe and easy access to water supply, sanitation facilities and services, and that such services and facilities are appropriate. The main objective of this intervention is to provide safe drinking water and even to improve on the sanitation aspect of the residence in the target districts. We also intent to reduce the transmission of and exposure to water borne diseases (AWD/cholera) among targeted at risk and vulnerable IDP populations. This shall be achieved through the provision of access to safe water, adequate and appropriate sanitation facilities and services. The project also aims to ensure that the targeted communities are sensitized, mobilized on best practices to prevent water and sanitation related diseases (AWD/cholera). All will be offered at community and facility level to reach all.",

        "description": "This project is designed to provide emergency and lifesaving nutrition services to 21984 vulnerable persons (3936 men, 5204 women, 5474 boys and 7370 girls) living in Balcad, cadale and Mahaday districts of Middle Shabelle. The intervention will target pregnant and lactating women (PLW) together with children under the age of 5 years (CU5) amongst the host communities, IDPs and returnees in the Balcad district where Wocca is the primary rationalized partner in Adale where we are the secondary rationalized partner and also extend our services to Mahaday.  Wocca will operate 2 fixed/static outpatient therapeutic feeding centers (fixed OTPs) and 4 mobile outpatient therapeutic feeding programme teams (mobile OTPs) targeting 16 locations chosen on the basis of vulnerability and absence of nutrition interventions in the 3 districts. The static facilities will be established in Ceelow and Caddow Uul locations  and Cadale districts respectively while the 4 outreach teams will serve 14 locations namely Bulo Axmed Cigow, Kulmis Weyn, Buurfuule and Xudur Ciise in Mahaday Ceelka Cusub, Cisiley and Sheikh Rooble Garas weyne, Cadan gabey and Ceel Xamar in Cadale Xanlay, Muki dheere Bari, Bulo Walaal and Caro faag in Balcad. WOCCA has engaged UNICEF for backstopping during training of the project staff, community health workers (CHWs) and mothers for the \u201cmothers MUAC approach\u201d, on nutrition screening and case identification, Integrated management of acute malnutrition(IMAM),Infant and young child feeding education (IYCF-E) and Nutrition, health and hygiene promotion (NHHP).The trained staff shall be deployed to the targeted locations, mobile and static OTPs where together with the trained mothers will screen children under 5 and PLWs. Children under 5 with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) conditions and no medical complications will be enrolled to the static and mobile OTPs for treatment while the cases with medical complications will be referred by the mobile clinics and CHWs to the stabilization center (SC) in Waberi star village managed by WOCCA for nutrition and medical rehabilitation. Children under 5 and PLWs with MAM conditions will be referred to TSFP center managed by ARC. CHWs and Hygiene promoters will be trained on Nutrition, Health and Hygiene Promotion (NHHP), they will disseminate hygiene promotion messages to the communities to prevent outbreak and spread of communicable diseases like AWD/cholera during the activities as they move around with the mobile Team. Mothers will be counseled individually and in groups by trained nutrition staff and Community Health Workers (CHWs) on appropriate maternal infant and young child feeding as part of efforts to prevent malnutrition. The project will also provide micronutrient support by distributing multiple micronutrients (MNPs) and Vitamin A supplements to pregnant and lactating women and children under the age of 5years through the static and mobile facilities. UNICEF has been supporting WOCCA with nutrition supplies and technical guidance on previous nutrition projects within the targeted locations and currently supporting our SHF funded project running in Daynille/Kaxda IDP camps and in Balcad district. Therefore, in this project WOCCA will still engage UNICEF to provide nutrition supplies and technical support for management of SAM cases. To enhance effective coordination, WOCCA will provide monthly activity updates with partners including Nutrition cluster both regional and Nairobi level, Other agencies working in the field who are doing other sector projects in the project sites will also be updated to avoid duplication and promote effective and efficient utilization humanitarian fund.",

Moreover, this project will also focus on building the capacities of the IDP leadership and local actors to gradually take over the camp management responsibilities. \n\nNoFYL will conduct the basic care and maintenance of the camps in Daynille District and spontaneous settlements in the Afgooye District the upcoming care and maintenance phase presents a different range of challenges, requiring strong humanitarian leadership and very close engagement with the population to promote community ownership and empowerment, as well as the gradual transfer of responsibility for the care of the site infrastructure. NoFYL will continue to work regularly with IDP camp leadership and committees to strengthen collaboration and their participation in decision-making processes, while also striving to improve diversity in representation and gender balance in the governance structure. As NoFYL anticipates, new arrivals will continue to seek shelter within the sites and spontaneous settlements throughout the project period, NoFYL's Camp Management team will support this population with reception and conduct site verification monthly. The quarterly Site Verification exercise in Afgoye district will be conducted to provide multi-sector information on access and availability to basic services in the floods affected sites to ascertain gaps in service provision and monitor services being provided, the verification will be conducted by NoFYL's multi-functional mobile teams, this will help to produce detailed information on the population of each site, its perimeter, access and services available in sites. NoFYL will use this data and contribute to its dissemination in order to inform humanitarian response at each level.\n\nThis overarching objective will be achieved by enhancing the overall protective environment for flood-affected population, increasing access to basic services linked to different sectors, reducing the risk, and availing specialized support assistance to beneficiaries to help them address other interconnected protection concerns. The action is also conceptualized to consolidate the ongoing humanitarian response to the flood situation in the targeted locations. Through this grant, NoFYL will reach 1,550 HHs in 8 umbrella Camps (considering minimum 180 HHs per settlement) with a total target beneficiary of 12,400 in Daynille and  Afgooye districts with necessary services through a coordination mechanism set in place with relevant stakeholders and other partners.\n\nThis project will also be linked to this ongoing protection/HLP activities through monitoring, documentation, and reporting of threats to evictions by assessing potential eviction sites, preventing and responding to eviction. Capacity development targeting settlement managers, CMCs, and local authorities on Housing, Land, and proper protection monitoring through ensuring collection of information based on the methodology of the Somalia Protection Monitoring System (SPMS).",

        "description": "This project is designed to respond to education, WASH and protection needs of children affected by floods in seven rural villages of Jowhar District of Middle Shabelle in Hirshabelle State of Somali for six months. The villages have either been affected by floods due to River Shabelle breaking its banks and flooding the settlements and farmlands in the riverine areas or flash floods sweeping the villages as a result of above-normal heavy Hagaa rains experienced in the region. The Guu rains expected between October and December are likely to result further deterioration of the situation.\nEducation facilities in the targeted villages are closed since most of them were affected either flood from river bank breakage that saw them completely inundated or marooned by water. \nThe villages are generally food insecure as the population is faced with acute unemployment, the prohibitive cost of living, and lack of skill sets by majority of the dwellers to eke meaningful living. The situation is further exacerbated by cyclic droughts and flash floods that are making agro-pastoralism lifestyle untenable and thus many are dropping out to join the ever-increasing population of vulnerable persons in the riverine regions. The worst affected are children and women who often bear the brunt of neglect and abandonment during these hard times. This often makes them susceptible to abuses and exploitations such as Gender-Based Violence, sexual exploitation, early marriages, child labor and recruitment to armed groups. \nThe project intends to use school attendance as an important preventive factor for child protection, particularly the girl-child. The project will employ such interventions as, training of teachers on basic child protection skills, provision of child-friendly environment through improvement and repair of damaged temporary/ permanent classrooms. Aid Vision will establish and strengthen the capacity of CtC clubs to provide peer interaction forums to learners, provision of teaching and learning materials-including recreational materials, capacity building of CBCPCs to raise awareness on risks of child abuse and enhance children\u2019s access and retention at schools. The CBCPCs will contribute to service mapping, identification of referral pathways and disseminate the information about available child protection service for children in the community. CP Focal Points, trained on PSS/PFA, will facilitate structured gender sensitive recreational and PSS activities at the schools for both boys and girls throughout the project live and conduct child safety walk and audit/ /risk mapping exercises with the guidance of project CP supervisor.\nTo address urgent WASH needs at the schools and ensure continuous learning for 2000 learners, Aid Vision will supply water to 7 schools for 6 months which will be delivered by trucks. Each school will have water storage tank with taps placed at strategic location for easy access. 23 twin gender-sensitive latrines will be constructed at schools that lack sanitation facilities. All latrines will have sufficient water, hand washing facilities and lockable doors for meaningful access. Girls and boys will attend CP awareness sessions to be organized for all schools. This is aimed at ensuring they have preventive skills on violence against children. Girls latrines usage will be monitored and corrective actions taken to address safety concerns. Regular hygiene promotion campaigns focusing on handwashing and safe water handling will be conducted at schools for 14 days to prevent the risk of AWD/Cholera outbreak. Hygiene promotion sessions will follow where schools\u2019 health clubs will disseminate messages on good hygiene practices at schools. To ensure schools have sustained access to water 2 shallow wells damaged by floods will be rehabilitated and protected with hand-pumps. 9 manually operated hand-free hand washing stations will be installed and soap for hand washing provided to reduce risk/transmission of COVID-19.",

        "description": "The floods have been triggered by heavy, above-average rainfall locally and in upstream areas in the Ethiopian highlands and have affected Gedo, Hiraan, Middle Juba, and Middle and Lower Shabelle regions. The situation has been exacerbated by weak river embankments and open riverbanks. The worst affected districts are Balcad, Jowhar, and Mahaday in Middle Shabelle (Hirshabelle) Afgooye and Wanlaweyn districts in Lower Shabelle (South West State), and Belet Weyne (Hiraan) where over 85 percent of the displacement has occurred. Somalia\u2019s marginalized communities and internally displaced persons are expected to most severely be affected by the impact of the floods. An estimated 132,000 hectares (ha) of agricultural land and 294 villages along the Shabelle River have been affected by the Hagaa floods. New displacements and further disruption to livelihoods are expected as foreseen moderate to heavy rainfall in the Ethiopian highlands are likely to raise Shabelle River levels over the coming weeks, likely resulting in additional flooding in the middle and lower reaches of the Shabelle. Of particular concern is Jowhar town and its environs in Middle Shabelle, where the river level is near the full crest, and other riverine towns in the Lower Shabelle region. Thus, in this project ZAMZAM foundation aims to extend immediate support to the flood-affected most vulnerable men, women, and children including disabilities and marginalized communities and IDPs in Jowhar district through immediate support to food access, protect their livelihoods, support local food production, and prevent the adoption of crisis strategies. In order to reach the objective of the project ZAMZAM will carry the following activities: \n(1) Increase access to food and improve nutrition through Unconditional cash transfer to 555 HHS representing 3,330 most vulnerable groups of the community in Jowhar district including widows, women head HH, families with disabilities, or with severe prolonged illness, and isolated families without external support. The supporting period will be 3 months and the rate is 60% of Minimum Expenditure Basket (MEB) which corresponding to 60 USD. (2) Restore the livelihood to 2,310 flood-affected vulnerable farmers through the distribution of agricultural input, to start their farming activities, protect their livelihoods, support local food production, and prevent adaption of crisis strategies. The selection criteria of the project beneficiaries will be: (1) Women headed households, (2) households with disabilities, (3) households with malnourished children and women (4) poor households, and (5) households with farming lands. \nDuring the selection of the beneficiaries, ZAMZAM will consult with the line ministry, district local authority, community leaders, women groups, disabled people, marginalized communities, and religious groups, in order to make the selection fair, transparency, and accountability.\n\n(3) To keep the sustainability of the project and increase the production of the beneficiaries, ZAMZAM will train selected 200 lead farmers to share equally men and women from the target farmers on the best technologies and methodologies to increase their livelihoods production.\n\nThe project will seek to increase food supply, reduce hunger, counter rising food prices, and improve responses to food emergency crisis by extending the area of land cultivated under good agricultural practices. The project will use a similar approach to improve the use of adapted varieties, early planting, correct sowing, use of soil enhancing plant species, observing rotations, precision fertilizer placement and timely application, correct spacing, timely weeding, and post-harvest storage.",

The appeal to the United Nations for support is a matter of urgency as those two referral facilities are facing a dire need to keep power stability while treating and testing patients with COVID-19.  \nThe RC/HC has decided to use the Humanitarian response funds to finance the support and requested UNDP to handle the procurement process to provide the generators. From the quotations already sought by the OPM, the estimate cost for the two generators is USD 160,000 including delivery and installation. UNDP is currently launching its own competitive sourcing to come up with financial proposals for contracting the supplier with the best value for money.

The project implementation has a duration of six months and is expected to start in October 2020 and end in March 2021. The project-specific target beneficiary is 12546 people comprising of internally displaced people and the host community. Since the target community is currently living at either far or hard to reach places they will be reached through mobile medical outreaches. The outreach sites will be at four sites which will serve the nearest population as follows Agal Gubay yarey (Sagaaroole,Tugaarey villages),Dhumeyga (Aw Osman, Dhumeyga, Balcad and Fulay Dheere villages) Siigole (Siigoole and Heeribka villages and Xabaa fiiley(Laba garas,Dhajalaq and Masiirey villages. Four integrated emergency response teams each consisting of 1 clinical officer, 1nurse,2 auxiliary nurses,1 midwife,1 vaccinator,1 community mobilizer/IYCF promoter, and 1 registrar will be put in place to provide the needed services. During the medical mobile outreach, a comprehensive package comprising of treatment of minor ailments strengthened early warning for disease outbreaks, reproductive health services( maternal ampfamily planning), counseling and psychosocial support, health education, community dialogues, medical supplies, immunization, micronutrient supplementation, screening for malnutrition and referral, infant and young child feeding in emergency and management of uncomplicated severe acute malnutrition in children under-fives and moderate acute malnourished pregnant and lactating women.\nThe project will support capacity development of the integrated emergency response team through classroom training, on the job training, and continuous mentorship to ensure they have adequate and relevant knowledge and skills to provide quality services to the population affected by the floods. The project will support the community mobilizers to do a regular screening for malnutrition and referral at the household level to ensure that all acute malnourished children are identified and enrolled in the outpatient therapeutic program for management while in need of inpatient care are referred for further investigation and support to identified health facilities. Also, the community mobilizers will help in social mobilization and awareness creation of the services available to the community members to create demand for the services. \nEffective disease surveillance mechanisms will be put in place to monitor any significant outbreaks and deterioration in the health and nutrition status of the target community. The promotion of appropriate IYCF practices will be conducted both at outreach sites and community levels to enhance the community\u2019s knowledge, attitude, behavior, and practice.",

        "description": "Displacement, cramped living conditions and other related stressors following flooding all serve to exacerbate tensions and increase violence in the home and in communities, with women and girls most at risk. With an increase in Gender Based Violence following flooding in Beledweyne and Afgooye, there is an urgent need to improve access to quality multi-sectorial support for survivors and enhance community based protection mechanisms.  \nTo address this, RI will run two Women and Girl Safe Spaces (WGSS) in Beletwyne and Afgooye. One of the WGSS will be static located within a health facility in Afgooye and the other WGSS in Beletwyne will be mobile in nature and linked to one of RI supported static WGSSs at the health facilities for referrals and further support of the survivors. RI is running 4 static WGSS in Beletwyne with support of UNFPA. The Mobile WGSS will be able to reach out to higher grounds where communities have relocated yet cannot access the static WGSS facilities. Approximately 400 women and girls will be reached with advocacy, PSS, referral, case management and material support. \nBoth static and Mobile WGSS will be staffed with female and male GBV staff, CHWs and medical staff who will provide GBV response and services to targeted communities. While the medical team will be responding to offering GBV related medical treatment, the GBV staff will run both men and women sessions separately while the CHWs will be conducting door to door GBV awareness and provide avenues for safe reporting of GBV and referrals to Mobile unit team for medical, PSS and case management. WGSS staff will provide survivor centred case management through PFA, medical treatment and facilitating referrals for other services. In addition, the WGGS will serve as a place where women and men meet weekly to get information on GBV prevention and response and establish social support groups where they share and learn from each other. The WGSS are designed with the specific needs of women and girls to have the space they need to be able to voice their concerns and needs in regards to issues that affect them personally.\nRI will update and strengthen already existing linkages with other GBV service providers for referral purposes and to ensure survivors and those at risk are able to access quality multi-sectoral services as needed with RI providing support and follow-up on all cases. RI will work with community health workers to ensure they have the necessary skills and understanding to identify GBV cases and make appropriate referrals. \nTo enhance community-based protection mechanisms, RI will work with all members of communities, including both IDPs and Host Community members women, men, boys and girls, and community/ religious leaders. Activities will include awareness campaigns, advocacy platforms, community protection audits and trainings. \nThe project is expected to reach 5,989 direct beneficiaries (3,929 female and 2,060 male) and 93, 545 indirect beneficiaries. Approximately 50 (20 girls and women) will be engaged in GBV safety audit and action planning in their communities. 4,000 (1,220girls,1,260 women, 800 boys and 720 men) will be reached through door to door community outreach and over 25,000 reached through GBV radio advocacy and awareness creation. 450 dignity kits and 250 emergency support kits and 2000 sanitary kits will be distributed. Approximately 150 GBV survivors will be supported to access survivor centered multi-sectorial response and material support. A total of 25 religious leaders will be engaged in GBV advocacy and 14 (9 female) clinical and non-clinical staff will be trained on GBV response including Clinical Management of Rape (CMR), Psychological First Aid (PFA), and Psychosocial Support (PSS) and GBV Case management.

        "description": "In response to the growing humanitarian crisis in southern Somalia SOS CVS is proposing the following interventions to expand lifesaving Child protection and GBV services to vulnerable populations in two districts in middle Shabelle region. SOS CVS will support the most deprived children, women and girls in IDP camps, those affected by emergencies, crisis and displacements, those at risk of family separation as well as victims of gender based violence whose vulnerability increases due to breakdown in community structures. The project will be implemented in two districts in Middle Shabelle region (Balcad and Jowhar)\n\nThe main objective of the proposed integrated protection project is to improve the protection of the targeted children, girls and women from abuse, violence and exploitation in the target area. The  integrated protection emergency response  is designed to improve the protection of the target children, girls and women from abuse, violence and exploitation through provision of psychosocial and mental health support  and provide rapid identification, tracing and family reunification services for those at risk of family separations. In addition to this, unaccompanied and separated children in the intervention targeted IDPs will be reunified with their caregivers/guardians and those children who do not have caregivers/guardians will be supported through community based (clan/kafala) foster care placements.  Through existing Community Protection Committees (CPC), provide a platform to establish community\u00ac based child protection mechanisms (CBCPMs) to facilitate the identification of and response to child protection concerns, the development of community\u00ac based mitigation plans, prevention messaging (e.g. on forced recruitment) and child protection surveillance mechanisms. \n\nThe project propose to create CFS at community level that will provide psychosocial and recreational support through structured and age appropriate group and individual activities including recreation, skill building and basic learning activities. The proposed CFS will also provide children with a protective and conducive environment to play socialize and learn to express themselves.  In addition, the project will provide psychosocial and parenting activities to both IDPS and host communities and their caregivers. The project will provide community-based PSS and resilience activities aimed towards coping and strengthening protective environment for children and their parents. Child right groups will be established at community level and provide psychosocial support (PSS) workshops (MHPSS) services to key targeted beneficiaries in view of increasing child resilience in IDP and surrounding communities. This will be conducted in the CFS centers at the community level.\nThe project will also carry out community based mapping to identify safety risk for children and provide  insight into what issues exist and better understanding of how issues connect to each other and plan for mitigation to support the identified risk.\n\nThe project is also designed to increase women and adolescent girls access to life saving prevention and response measures through providing GBV services, case management, PSS counselling to traumatized GBV survivors to reduce risk of GBV at target districts.  To provide timely, effective and efficient GBV responses, the proposed project will train health workers and caseworkers in CM and CMR of rape survivors.  Community based GBV volunteers will be trained to conduct GBV services awareness campaign. This will offer an opportunity to provide much needed response services in the target areas that are without GBV and protection services.  \n\nFinally the intervention will also provide child protection awareness creation on COVID 19 and adopt WHO and CP AoR approved IEC risk communication and print it in local language as well general awareness child protection prevention messages.",

Risk education activities implemented as part of the project will seek to reduce the risk of death and injury EO by raising awareness and promoting safe behavior. Most at-risk communities will be identified and reached through life-saving messages tailored to specific groups. \nTargeted communities will be better equipped to identify the threat and adopt safe behaviors, such as sharing information among their communities and reporting any suspicious items to the Somali authorities. To promote the sustainability of the project, MAG will build the capacity of local partners through the training of community liaison officers (CLOs) from JUMAN and the continuous monitoring, evaluation, and feedback of the activities implemented. This will enable them to continue delivering risk education messages, once the project is completed. Also, it will strengthen their position as key points to collect reports from the community and consolidate information related to EO contamination for future use of HMA stakeholders and Somali authorities. The effectiveness and scope of the intervention will be greatly improved by local partners with field teams who are familiar with the context.  \nOn measuring the impact, MAG expects to find based on previous data that over 70% of EORE recipients demonstrated improved knowledge and practices with regards to their recognition of and behavior around EO, while 70% of EORE recipients indicate they feel safer following the intervention. This methodology of conveying   EORE, the project will allow similar baseline figures to be collected with regards to the effectiveness of awareness risk education and used for future planning.\n\nAccording to the protection cluster (Abor Indicators for HNO Sept 2020), about 2,228,463    EO people are categorized as persons in need (PIN) for the explosive hazards awareness sensitization in the Banadir region where the project is targeting leveling them as severity phase 3 of which 497,000 are among the those displaced by the floods while 1,731,463    EO is the host communities in various districts within Banadir region. There were more than 5 accidents with fatalities and casualties in the Danyiile district alone this year which includes children and persons with no knowledge of Explosive ordinances.\n\nIn Afgooye about 191,143 persons standing as 100% of the population severity level no 3 described as degrading which puts them highly in need of protection against the explosive substances. Of these 56,000 are IDPs from the floods and other natural calamities while 135,431 are host communities according to the data recently shared by the protection cluster on HNO.\n\nExplosive ordinances contamination presents a barrier to development, and encumber livelihood activities particularly it affected IDPs, returnees, animal herders, and the rural poor families.",

These areas are currently concerned by displacement and voluntary return movements and, with the intensification of the military operations around AS control areas, it is expected that a high number of newly displaced people and/or newly accessible people will be imminently in need of critical assistance. Further to this, recent wave of flooding affected a significant segment of the population in Jubaland and several parts of South Central, including Kismayo and Belet Weyne in Hirshabelle. In addition to physical destruction, communities lost HLP assets and are now being confronted with the daunting prospect of either recovering abandoned assets or engaging in recovery initiatives that would help to develop or re-acquire such assets. As part of the response framework, the project will provide populations falling into such categories with specialised support assistance to help them overcome legal obstacles central to the protection, exercise and enjoyment of their HLP rights. The project also seeks to develop adequate HLP capacity within these communities, to co-exist peacefully and be protected from unlawful evictions, and to help stakeholders better understand the extent of the damage to HLP assets as well as alternatives to addressing the problem. The project will also conduct HLP assessments by mapping damaged HLP assets and the implication of the damage to protection outcomes and the enjoyment of rights. NoFYL will also undertake Post flood eviction response, prevention initiatives, negotiations and monitoring and reporting. HLP Legal aid service provision will also be supported through the project.\n\n\nThe overarching objective is to monitor and report on protection risks, human rights violations and gaps in available service, are identified and addressed through protection monitoring and analysis.\n\nTo achieve the expected outcome NoFYL will through its skilled and highly trained monitors will collect accurate data/information on displacement and protection incident necessary to inform responsive and strategically targeted humanitarian response in the target locations. The expected outcome will also be achieved through enhancing access to emergency protection assistance for populations victimised by serious protection incidents through referral to specialised support services, include psycho social and clinical support by specialized case workers and nurses. \n\nThe project will have the following outcomes.\n\n1.\tIncreased availability of information necessary to inform responsive and strategically targeted humanitarian response in Kismayo amp Balcad.\n2.\tEnhanced access to emergency protection assistance for populations victimized by serious protection incidents including provision of emergency protection assistance and referrals for specialized care.\n3.\tJoint multi-sectoral assessments facilitated including eviction monitoring, post-return monitoring, service mapping, protection incident monitoring, ongoing rapid assessments on flood damage assessments, and alert reporting.\n4. \u2018   Communities supported to recover from the impact of flood.\n5.     Increased availability of legal services for post flood HLP issues.\n\nNoFYL is currently an SPMS partner leading data collections in Kismayo, Afgoye and Mogadishu (Deynille amp Kaxda districts).",

        "description": "The floods in Jowhar have affected many villages such as Buulo Maxamud, Khalafow, Guumeys, Gumarey, Guumeysta, Caliwarabey, Duray, Maryan Keynan, Dhay-Gawan. The villages are home to pastoralists and agrarian communities.  Other villages that are affected by the floods include Athale, Haji Ali, Mahaday, Sabuni, Congo, Grasweyn and Adow uul. According to OCHA updates 1 on Deyr Season Floods Update, as of 4 November 2020, the flood in Jowhar affected 27,364 person living in Jowhar .The update also reported that on 3rd and 4th November 2020, flash floods cut the road linking Jowhar to Mogadishu at a location 10 km south of Jowhar.  The floods also affected the road to the airport. On 12th and 13th October 2020, heavy rains triggered flash floods in the riverine villages affecting about 3,600 people.  The Jowhar authorities reported that two children drowned as the result of the flash floods.The floods caused various impact to the WASH facilities the findings indicate that only less than 10% of the total affected population have access to safe water drinking water. Most of the infrastructure such as latrines have submerged and destroyed as the result of the floods. Sanitation is a serious issue due to the inadequate number of latrines in comparison to the population in need and many people are practice open defecation due to lack of sufficient latrines against the population. Lack of adequate and safe sanitation puts women, girls and at risk of physical violence and sexual assault as they relieve themselves in the open field.The water have been contaminated and not fit for human consumption leading to potential outbreaks of water-borne diseases and acute water diarrhea.Therefore, in order to fill the gaps Islamic relief Somalia with funding from OCHA is planning to fill the gaps by rehabilitating of 5 shallow wells, two 2 boreholes and construction of 200 flood latrines.The project aims to tackle the effects emanating from the floods by providing emergency WASH services in Jowhar district, Somalia. The intervention is in line with the WASH strategy. It will also link to recovery and resilience building of the communities by rehabilitating WASH infrastructure that will assist 16,500 direct beneficiaries affected by Hagaa floods in Jowhar .The project will install solar power systems to the two (02) boreholes that are to be  rehabilitated  in jowhar depending on the needs while the rehabilitation of five (05) shallow wells will be undertaken at Mahaday,gumeysta,congo,marerey and cali warabey. The shallow wells will be rehabilitated, protected and upgrading including the installation of Two (2) boreholes that will be rehabilitated will be connected to water piping system including construction of four (4) water kiosk from the main borehole, gender balanced water management committees will be formed and trained. Islamic Relief Somalia will provide emergency water trucking to 4,000 beneficiaries in the rural areas of Jowhar district Each beneficiary will receive water in accordance with sphere standard of (7.5 liters/ per person per day). Water through tricks will be delivered on daily through blanket system which ensured beneficiaries know the quantity and where water should be collected.The displaced population in Jowhar are at risk of contracting malaria, acute bloody or watery diarrhoea, measles and other sanitation related diseases, The project will construct 200 emergency pit latrines to reduce AWD cases and improve the sanitation services. The latrines will be designed in line with the protection guidelines and segregated according to the sex. 20 latrines will be designed to meet the special requirements of people with disability.The project will construct and install 10 COVID-19 hand washing stations in order to  prevent COVID-19.The IDPs and the host communities will benefit from hygiene promotion campaigns focusing on hand washing with soap and production of IEC materials.1500 HHs will receive hygiene kits.",

The floods have displaced in Wanlaweyn alone more than 82,000 people, inundated homes, wells and schools and destroyed large swathes of farmland and crops The heavy deyr rains ave caused massive population displacement, damaged housing, property, infrastructure and farm lands in riverine areas in southern Somalia. WASH Cluster has reported critical gaps in Balcad, Marka and Wanlaweyn where no WASH assistance has been received despite high risk levels for AWD.\nThe main aim of this project is to provide lifesaving WASH services to most vulnerable and underserved communities living in floods affected areas in Wanlaweyn district of Lower Shabelle Region. A total of 17,000 flood affected men, women and children including the disabilities, marginalized communities and IDPs will benefit safe drinking water and will have access equally throughout the project period.\n\nSOYDA in collaboration with the local authority, partnership with main water vendors in rural villages in Wanlaweyn district, will provide emergency water voucher to the 6,400 (1408 men, 1,536 women, 1,728 boys and 1,728 girls) targeted beneficiaries including people with disabilities and marginalized communities in the targeted IDP camps, which they can redeem for water at the specified water vendors (water trucks). The action also includes to hire water truck of a capacity of 6,000 liters of safe water to the targeted locations. Each voucher can be used to redeem specified quantity of safe water of 7.5 liters per person per day for a period of 30 days. The project will build the capacity of 1q WASH Committees (composing 4 men and 3 women per Committee) shared equally men and women on operation and maintenance of developed water infrastructures shall be throughout the project implementation period, to ensure the sustainability of the developed water facilities after the project is faced out. SOYDA will make sure that men, women, girls and boys including people with disabilities and marginalized community have equal access to the rehabilitated/constructed WASH services. SOYDA will upgrade/rehabilitate two boreholes equipped with hybrid to improve its water quality and reduce its running cost, in order to receive the community their water needs at an affordable cost. SOYDA will replace the engine powered boreholes in to hybrid system and construct 8 water kiosks nearer to the IDP settlements supplied water through piping network to avoid the risk of rape against women and girls in Wanlaweyn district. The project will provide reliable and sustainable access to environmental sanitation through construction of 100 IDP latrines in Wanlaweyn district. The latrines will be gender separated and flood proof with lockable doors and hand washing basins. construction of latrines will be implemented through market-based programming. \n\nSOYDA will distribute 80 sanitation sets to 10 IDP camps, in order to improve the environmental sanitation of the targeted locations. The aim of the sanitation sets distribution is to carry out clean-up campaigns, in order to reduce the spread of AWD/cholera diseases and to improve the environmental sanitation of the target locations. SOYDA will conduct comprehensive hygiene promotion campaigns focusing hand washing with soap practices to 17,000 men, women, boys and girls through visiting house to house, health facilities, and nutrition centers. SOYDA will also train 30 Community Hygiene Promoters (CHPs) shared equally men and women, selected from the target communities and IDPs, so that in their turn they can educate the entire population to change their behaviors. 1600 HP kits will be distributed to the most vulnerable and underserved communities in the target locations",

The worst affected districts by floods are Balcad, Jowhar and Mahaday in Middle Shabelle (Hirshabelle) Afgooye and Wanlaweyn distr icts in Lower Shabelle (South West State) and Belet Weyne (Hiraan) where over 85 per cent of the displacement has occurred. The flooding situation in Balcad district has resulted in massive displacement affecting particularly children, mothers and the elderly who are now facing serious hunger, health and protection risks in an area already receiving little to no humanitarian assistance due to insecurity. The floods have destroyed food reserves and threatened food markets. Significant gaps have been reported in flood-affected areas regarding to food, emergency shelter, non-food items, and safe drinking water, sanitation facilities and poor hygiene. Mothers, children, and the elderly as well as disabled people are extra affected due to the fact that displacement puts them at risk of exploitation since they lack their normal income routines and familiar environment. People are at a high risk of hunger and illness such as water-borne diseases which has already been reported in some of the flood affected areas. The impact of the ongoing flooding in Hirshabelle compounded by economic and social impacts of COVID-19 and forecast of below-average Gu rainfall from October to December 2020 may result in further deterioration of humanitarian outcomes for affected communities through 2021. The proposed project aims to save the lives of affected communities in Balcad district and enhance resilience building by provide safe, equitable and sustainable access to safe and sufficient water for drinking, cooking, personal, and domestic (15L/p/day) through by drilling and construction of 1 borehole and rehabilitation of 3 boreholes and 5 shallow wells, construction of 100 flood proof latrines that consider the disable people, distribution of hygiene and sanitation kits to improve sanitation conditions and establishment and train water management committees to the operation and maintenance of the facilities. The project will target the most vulnerable households (men, women boys and girls) affected  differently by the ongoing floods but give special attention to female-headed households, the  elderly and people living with disability. Market-based programming (MBP) will be considered in all the activities to strengthen and working with existing markets supply chains and service providers in project target areas to meet the needs of crisis-affected populations.GSA has extensive experience of working in the WASH sector within Balcad district and can mobilize rapidly due to strong links with communities and government.",

The floods have been triggered by heavy, above-average rainfall locally and in upstream areas in the Ethiopian highlands and have affected Gedo, Hiraan, Middle Juba, and Middle and Lower Shabelle regions. The floods have been triggered by heavy, above-average rainfall locally and in upstream areas in the Ethiopian highlands and have affected Gedo, Hiraan, Middle Juba, and Middle and Lower Shabelle regions. The floods temporarily displaced households to higher grounds in several prone areas including Belet Weyne. The recurrent floods have inundated the roads, WASH infrastructures, crops, houses and etc. A cholera outbreak fueled by limited access to safe drinking water, poor sanitation, and displacement has already been reported in some of the flood-affected districts, underscoring the need for urgent repair and rehabilitation to damaged WASH infrastructure and the provision of clean water. More cases of acute watery diarrhea (AWD) are being reported in children under five years old, who are particularly vulnerable to disease, especially if their immune systems are compromised by malnutrition. Thus, in this project, AADSOM will improve access to safe water, sanitation facilities and promote good hygiene practices to reduce the negative impacts of the flood in the Belet Weyne town and 9 villages in Belet Weyne district to 19,000 women, men, boys, and girls including people with disabilities, minorities and most vulnerable underserved communities. Key activities AADSOM would like to undertake within this project the following WASH services:\nWater:\n- Provision of safe water to 1,000 households representing 6,000 men, women and children affected population through water vendors (water trucking) by using Water Voucher (WV) \n- Rehabilitation/construction of 29 flood-damaged shallow wells with hand pumps.\n- Establishment and capacity building training to gender-balanced 29 WASH committees and 58 Well Operators shared equally by men and women, to ensure continuity of service, operation, and maintenance, coupled training on DDR and conflict resolution mechanisms as cross-cutting\n\nHygiene and Sanitation:\nLack of access to adequate and appropriate sanitation and hygiene poses a serious threat to public health. The practice of open defecation is a leading cause of fecal-oral transmission of diseases with children being the most vulnerable. A safe and appropriate latrine accompanied by handwashing with soap provides an effective barrier to the transmission of diseases. The provision of appropriate facilities for defecation is also an essential response for people\u2019s dignity, safety, health, and well-being. To improve safe access to sanitation it is necessary to meet standards of privacy and safety of women and girls against GBV using sanitation structures that are locally or culturally acceptable. never the less, the disabilities will be given a special design that is appropriate and acceptable for use. in this project, AADSOM will: \n\n- Conduct comprehensive hygiene promotion campaigns to reach 19,000 men, women, boys, and girls through visiting house to house, schools, health centers, and feeding centers \n-Train 10 community hygiene promoters (5 men and 5 women), who will carry out hygiene promotion activities during and after the project is faced out \n-Distribute of 1,000 HP kits to 1,000 households with vulnerable men, women, and children, and\n- Construct 263 gender-sensitive and flood-proof latrines for the most affected community including latrines for disabled people in ensuring the sustainability of the latrines during floods.",

        "description": "Merka communities face scarcity of safe and sufficient water due to abnormal dryness and floods coupled with the effect of pandemic since march 2020. At this critical moment, vulnerable communities rely on unsafe water for drinking and domestic use, leading to increased health risks and poor living standards. Floods further undermine the sanitation services available in Merka and its environs. During the most recent floods in August 2020, over 60 percent of latrines were non-functional due to the floods leading to high rates of open defecation and increased incidences of water-borne diseases. To reverse the negative impact of recent natural hazards and increase the resilience of Merka IDP and host communities, a sustainable WASH intervention capable of withstanding these shocks and improving living standards is vital. ARD will respond to this compounded risk by implementing living saving WASH services in six largely underserved and high-WASH risk IDP sites in Merka, including Ceel xaaji, Ceel Ahmed ,Shalaamboot,Horseed and Ceel Jaale IDP sites, and will serve 3,000 households (18,000 individuals). The below proposed WASH activities are fully aligned with allocation strategy for flood response and as well as WASH cluster response strategy detailed in HRP 2020\nWater \nThrough water voucher assistance for a period of 60 days, provide safe drinking water to 1,300 flood affected families who have no access to clean water, or their water points are unsafe for drinking and needs disinfection and rehabilitation\nConstruction/rehabilitation 20 unprotected shallow wells installed with hand pumps. ARD will ensure the all rehabilitated wells will have infrastructures that can resist future floods. \nTo ensure the sustainability of rehabilitated water infrastructures, 20 WASH committees and 40 well operators will be trained on operation and management of water facilities.\nSanitation\nConstruction of 140 gender separated and desludgable flood proof latrines with lockable doors and handwashing facilities benefitting a total of 4,200 flood/AWD/cholera affected people.

        "description": "With the complex and unpredictable humanitarian situation in Somalia and with the reduced risk of famine in the year 2019, the overall risk still lingers. Two long decades of armed conflicts, clan clashes and drought have resulted in millions of Somalis becoming in dire need of basic life savings assistance. Forced to flee their homes to survive, today there remains a staggering 2.6 million internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Somalia. Based on total numbers, Somalia represents the fourth largest IDP crisis in the world. \n\nCurrently, an estimated 2.6 million people across Somalia remain internally displaced and highly impoverished. Deyr assessment results indicate that the 11 major Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) settlements are in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or Stressed (IPC Phase 2) in the presence of humanitarian assistance. In most urban areas, food security outcomes are Stressed (IPC Phase 2) or Minimal (IPC Phase 1). However, households in urban areas in Burao (Toghdeer) region are facing food consumption gaps and are classified as Crisis (IPC Phase 3), driven by high cost of living and limited income-earning opportunities. This notwithstanding, the sustained and large scale humanitarian coordination is preventing more severe outcomes in many regions across Somalia. \nIn this context ACTED will: Establish, reinforce and strengthen governance, management and coordination mechanisms at appropriate levels Increase site safety through site maintenance and improvement works and Capacity Build Camp Governance, CCCM stakeholders and local authorities working towards self-management. ACTED will implement this intervention in 31 sites across Burao and Buhodle (16 sites in Burao and 15 sites in Buhodle). \n\nFEWS NET Post Deyr technical release projects that in Togdheer region of Somaliland that 181,000 people will be stressed IPC phase 2, 91,000 in crisis IPC phase 3 and 13,000 in emergency IPC phase 4 by June, 2020 if humanitarian assistance is not extended to the region. \n\nCamp coordination and camp management is a relatively new concept within the region and it is of utmost importance that key stakeholders i.e. government officials and humanitarian actors, be sensitized on this concept. It is necessary to increase awareness on this technical concept and equip stakeholders with the relevant capacity to implement such interventions.",

NoFYL will implement a multi-cluster intervention around Protection and CCCM aiming at strengthening coordination structures, improving the coordination, community-led site maintenance activities to ensure the upkeep of sites, support governance structures to ensure community participation and self-management of sites and information management at a site level, sites improvement activities to minimize protection risks and ensure safety in sites. \nOn protection, the intervention is geared toward preventing and responding to eviction, monitoring of threats to evictions by assessing potential eviction sites, monitoring, documentation and reporting to relevant authorities and relevant clusters to mobilize support for advocacy. The advocacy and campaigns will aim to ensure actors facilitate lawful eviction processes. Capacity development targeting settlement managers, local authorities on Housing, Land and proper protection monitoring through ensuring collection of information based on the methodology of the Somalia Protection Monitoring System (SPMS). WASH intervention will be complemented by PAH through the distribution of complete kits of hygiene, capacity building of water committees and community hygiene promotion through community outreach and awareness campaigns, addressing sustainable access to water, hygiene, and capacity building needs. ESNFI intervention will be complemented by HINNA by improving the IDPs living conditions through the distribution of emergency NFI kits and emergency shelter kits.\n\nAt the initial stages of project implementation, the partners will organize an inception meeting with different actors with the support of the relevant cluster Coordinators. Rapid service mapping of actors will also be conducted to understand who is doing what and where to inform intervention areas and avoid duplication. NoFYL field teams shall actively participate in coordination mechanisms in Kaxda and Deynille to ensure other actors are updated on NoFYL plans in targeted districts to avoid overlap. This project will fill existing gaps in ESNFI, CCCM, Protection, and WASH support and complement activities undertaken under other ongoing projects. NoFYL will carry out post-distribution monitoring utilizing a tailored PDM tool in all targeted locations within 1 month of each assistance intervention sampling 20-30% of beneficiaries in each location. \n \nNoFYL, PAH and HINNA will implement these activities in 15 IDP sites in Deynille and Kaxda, targeting the most underserved area home to most newly displaced drought IDPs in the same sites to enhance the delivery of protection services as a complement to the other activities. 4,064 households, approximately 24,384 people (3,283 male, 4,886 female, 6,505 boys and 9,710 girls) will benefit from this intervention, as well as the whole community working in these 41 IDP sites including local authorities, clusters, and other organizations. The multi-sectoral approach will be useful to create synergies enabling the concentration of services and expertise within the same location and the same population leading to achieving a greater impact.\n \nThe three partners (NoFYL, PAH and HINNA) will build on each other strengths and better complement each other to ensure community acceptance and success in implementation. The synergy between the 3 sectoral partners will ensure sound management of the program, greater impact, efficiency, and more cost-effective operations.

        "description": "In 2019, COVID-19 emerged, and the WHO has declared its outbreak as a global pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic is a global health crisis that has resulted in a great disruption to education worldwide. Education has been hit particularly hard by the COVID-19 pandemic with 1.53 billion learners out of school and 184 country-wide school closures, impacting 87.6% of the world\u2019s total enrolled learners. Drop-out rates across the globe are likely to rise as a result of this massive disruption to education access. Thus, the Somali Government took precautionary measures as stopping international flights, closing learning institutions, and banning large public gathers. As the Government continues to monitor the situation, CISP plans to mitigate and minimize the impact of school closure and interrupted student learning, particularly for the most vulnerable. As there is a lack of clarity on how the COVID-19 situation will evolve globally and locally in Somalia, CISP will forecast long-term contingency measures ensuring that the impact of COVID-19 on students will be addressed as schools remain closed. In Somalia, it has affected learning and forced the closure of learning institutions including schools and universities since March 18th, 2020. In responding to this outbreak, CISP adapts the Ministry of Education, Culture, and Higher Education (MoECHE) strategy on COVID-19 preparedness and response. \nThe proposed 9-month intervention will target 12 schools with an enrolment of 3462 learners with the provision of food, TLM, and Dignity kit while 19,890 adults and children of school-going age children will be targeted with radio PSA and health messages to provide mitigation measures on the impact of COVID-19 on top of other existing challenges such as conflict, drought and desert locust for learners both school holidays and when schools reopen. The project will improve access to critical WASH inputs, emergency food for students to meet their food and energy needs, payment of emergency teacher incentives to motivate teachers to stay in the schools, provision of teaching and learning materials (TLM). Specific WASH activities will include the distribution of handwashing soaps, liquid detergents, rehabilitation of latrines, provision of storage water tanks, water trucking for schools with no constant water supply, and improving hygiene practices among children through engagement with school hygiene promoters. Following the Federal guideline on social distancing CISP will work with the ministry of health and MoECHE to explore the possibility of having smaller groups of teacher and CEC\u2019s to train so as to maintain 1.5-meter distance in order to implement a lifesaving training of hygiene and Sanitation on preparedness, mitigation and response to COVID-19 pandemic and identification of COVID-19 symptoms to prevent the spread of COVID-19 among the school community. CISP proposes this project to improve access to quality education and making schools child-friendly for COVID-19, drought and conflict-affected communities, and host community children Galgaduud region of Galmudug State of Somalia. The project directly addresses the educational needs of both the displaced and host community children. This project will create a protective environment for children through the improvement of hygiene/sanitation in schools thereby making schools learner-friendly and also the provision of quality education through providing learning resources, general community sensitization through radio PSA will be aired through Galmudug radio station on the COVID-19 pandemic awareness and prevention.",

Currently, 4 million people are experiencing acute food insecurity, out of whom 2.9 million are Stressed (IPC Phase 2) and 1.1 million are facing Crisis or worse. Among the most vulnerable are 2.6 million internally displaced persons (IDPs) who remain highly impoverished. According to IOM, October 2019 report, Baidoa, the capital of Bay region, hosts one of the largest IDP populations in Somalia. According to figures compiled by the international community, as of September 2019, Baidoa had 359,994 internally displaced persons, consisting of 51,322 households on 435 sites.\n\nTherefore, looking into this precarious situation, the proposed project is designed to respond to the immediate lifesaving and life sustaining basic needs of poor and vulnerable displacement affected communities in Bay region. Project proposes three rounds of Multipurpose cash transfers to the most vulnerable displacement affected communities. Moreover, project will also provide cereal crops and vegetable seeds to displacement affected communities living in the off camp area. At the same time this we understand that as a result of locust infestation, beneficiaries pastoral and agro-pastoral communities are forced to migrate to other areas, therefore under this program NRC will be providing Fodder vouchers to the migrating communities. Support in the form of fodder vouchers will help communities to purchase fodder for their livestock during the time of migration. This cash injection will help benefiting households in accessing food and other unmet needs on immediate basis from the accessible markets. The monthly cash transfer amount will be as per the cash and market working group recommended transfer rate which will help beneficiaries to meet 80% of the full minimum expenditure basket. As a result of cash injection, affected households will have improved access to the diversified food and will positively contribute to the nutritional outcomes. \n\nProposed project is in line with the Food Security cluster strategic response objectives SO1: Improve households\u2019 immediate access to food through provision of conditional and unconditional cash assistance depending on the severity of food insecurity phases, vulnerability and seasonality of the livelihoods.\n\nAs soon as beneficiaries identification and  registration will be completed, NRC will be conducting a Baseline survey in order to have baseline values. After baseline, registered beneficiaries will be released monthly multipurpose cash transfer in line to the cash and market recommended transfer rates using electronic services of Harmuud. NRC team will be collecting post distribution monitoring (PDM) data two weeks after release of each round of cash transfer. As a standard practice, PDM captures some of the key information around timeliness of support, progress against critical indicators including \u2018Food consumption score (FCS) and Household dietary diversity score\u2019. PDM also monitors expenditure patterns of the provided support and determines measures for corrective actions if there are deviations from objective.",

        "description": "The overall objective of the proposed project is that the food security situation of 865 vulnerable households (5160 individuals) in mostly rural communities in Zeylac district of Somaliland is stabilized and communities are more resilient towards adverse conditions.\n\nTo achieve the overall objective, the project offers: a) unconditional and b) conditional cash transfers for improved access to food. The project directly targets an estimated 5160 individuals ( mostly rural communities) particularly women, children and the elderly and other vulnerable persons in Casha Cado, Togoshi, Lawya cado, Sheikh Awaare and Zeyla villages. The project duration is 8 months to allow families to recover from adverse weather conditions and the potential desert locusts\u2019 threat. \n\nSpecifically, 565 households (HH) will receive Unconditional Cash Transfers (UCT) while 300 households will receive Conditional Cash Transfers. The cash transfers empower people with choice to address their essential and individual food needs, while also helping to boost local markets. Another reason for Candlelight to apply cash transfer are the reduced facilitation costs, as mobile transfers do require less administrative costs. The cash values to be transferred on a monthly basis are provided by the Cash Working Group (CWG) Somalia based on minimum expenditure basket (MEB) as per region across Somalia. The latest food cash transfer values for families in Awdal are USD 90 (October - December 2019)\n\nThe target group for the UCT will mainly be the rural and most vulnerable families facing high levels of food insecurity among other vulnerabilities. The timeframe for UCT to be disbursed will be 4 months to stabilize food security levels in the lean and Ramadhan seasons. The major activities for UCT will start with sharing selection criteria in a transparent manner with village leaders and communities. \n\nA local telephone company (Telesom) with extensive experience of conducting cash transfer to beneficiaries in remote areas will be commissioned to conduct monthly cash transfers to beneficiaries mobile phones. The beneficiaries who may not know how to use the services will be trained on how to use it. \n\nFor conditional cash transfers relating to Cash for Work (CfW) activities, the project will follow a similar selection and disbursement cycle. As part of CfW, the project will, village cleaning campaigns and rehabilitation/ replanting of mangrove forests especially in Toqoshi and Zeyla villages to provide for sustainable communal livelihood assets that enhance collective resilience. The individual sites for CfW activities will be identified together with the communities. The CfW beneficiary selection criterion will be their physical capacity in conjunction with the vulnerability of their families, such as families with more than three children, or families who lost major parts of their livestock and livelihoods. The families with men eligible for CfW might not be as vulnerable as the families receiving the UCT, however they have a risk of sliding into crisis mode. Beneficiaries shall be paid at a rate of approximately 7 USD each based on a standard piece of work but each beneficiary working for atleast 13 days in a month. Each 50 Cash for Work beneficiaries will be supervised by 1 foreman who will be paid a slightly high rate of approximately 10 USD each working day.",

The 7-month project will be implemented in 10 villages in Abudwak. The project has two outputs. Output one will contribute to 400 food-insecure households (2400 people \u2013 1224 Male and 1176 Female) having immediate access to food through unconditional Cash transfer. Of these,  200 HH are IDPs located in Abudwaq town. \nOutput 2 targets 1,632 HH (9794 people) in the protection and restoration of their livelihoods for increased food and income sources. Of these, 900 HH will benefit from animal treatment meant to restore approximately 27,000 livestock to better health. This intervention will improve the livestock economic value as well as the value of meat and milk for household consumption. 6,000 additional and emaciated livestock will receive animal feed concentrate for a month to help them recover their health and increase production. The project will install a solar-powered pumping system to pump water from the Dalsan village borehole to the elevated village water tank which will then use gravity to distribute to the village water kiosk and livestock watering troughs that were constructed by NAPAD with funding from German-FFO. Over 430 HH in Dalsan will benefit from climate and economic friendly source of water for their livestock estimated to be 12,960. To increase household access to nutritious food 100 women will be supported to diversify into small scale kitchen gardening of vegetables and fruits. These women will be capacity built on kitchen gardening, supported with seeds and farming tools and mentored by NAPAD agronomist in establishing the kitchen gardens in their homesteads. The farms will be designed to ensure that the least amount of water is utilized in agricultural production. Women from the Dalsan village will especially benefit from the proposed solar water pumping system that will provide water to irrigate the kitchen gardens. Inagabille households and livestock will get their water from NAPAD constructed, G-FFO funded elevated 60,000 litres tank and animal troughs.

        "description": "According to FSNAU Post Deyr 2019/2020 technical assessment, the overall health, food security and nutrition needs remain significant within most parts of Somalia with an estimated 43% of rural Nugal and Burtinle population in urgent need of humanitarian assistance (73,433 people, among them 2,073 in emergency, 21,350 in crisis and 50,010  being stressed. Nugaal region has consistently reported poor maternal amp child health and nutrition indicators ridden by high child and maternal morbidity rates, crude mortality rates and under 5 mortality rates. In December 2019, EPHS project that supported health and nutrition intervention in Nugaal came to a close. This left ta gap in health and nutrition in Nugaal. The Proposed project  will therefore bridge the major essential health care service gap that currently exists in Burtinle following the close out of the EPHS Project. The  project will  address the identified gaps in nutrition and health, enhancing access to integrated basic health and nutrition care services within their localities aimed at improving the physical and mental well-being of boys, girls, men and women in the targeted locations.  These specific needs have been outlined in the HNO, HRP and FSNAU and MOH gaps identified in the targeted locations. The proposed project is geared towards reducing the vulnerability of the beneficiaries and communities. World Vision Somalia (WV Som)  will work  with MOH to address the health and nutrition gaps identified. The services will be both preventive and curative targeting vulnerable men, women, boys, girls and persons living with physical disabilities in the 2 targeted districts. 1 Mobile and outreach implementation models will be adopted to address the unique needs of vulnerable beneficiaries in remote and geographically isolated populations in  Burtinle district.  Screening for malnutrition will be carried out and children with SAM will be treated in OTP sites. Children with MAM will be  registered through SCOPE to access  TSFP that is supported by WFP. Children diagnosed with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) with medical complication will be referred to the  SCs that World Vision propose to support in Burtinle  district.  At each of the 4  MCHs, WVI shall establish basic reproductive health care services aligned within the MISP framework, utilizing the ambulances to refer mothers with complications from the MCHs and PHUs to the hospitals. At each PHU WV shall build the capacity of the community midwives to provide basic reproductive health care services in remote hard to reach areas as a mitigation measure against preventable maternal morbidity and mortality. While engaging community volunteers, WV shall adopt Timed and targeted counselling (TTC) approach focusing on pre conception to the first 1000 days of a child\u2019s life also incorporating the Finish baby kit and Fortified rice and lentils (Vitameal) as a motivator for adoption of promoted health seeking practices among WCBA through enhancing access to Reproductive health care services, child health including Immunization ,IYCF and hygiene promotion care and care-giver led MUAC screening and referral . At 4 targeted MCHs and PHUs WV has an already established GBV care system with personnel already trained and necessary CMR supplies in place to respond to GBV cases.  World Vision will ensure that beneficiaries visiting the targeted facilities including beneficiaries served at the mobile sites access a comprehensive basic package of services .Towards health and nutrition promotion, World Vision will focus on NHHP, care-giver led MUAC screening that will be done at the project sites with the nutrition beneficiaries is linked with the food security and safety net interventions to enhance household food basket.",

        "description": "The proposed project has been developed in line with the Somalia Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) and the health and nutrition cluster strategic objectives of providing integrated lifesaving health and nutrition services for the cluster priority districts in Nugaal regions i.e. Garowe districts. It is also contributing to the cluster priority of filling critical gaps in health care services for populations facing high incidence of malnutrition and service gaps.\nThe project has also been designed with full awareness of the prevailing gender norms and deeply rooted gender inequalities in Somalia that limit women and girls from accessing basic services such as health and nutrition, and expose them to a higher risk of GBV. In order to address these challenges, Save the Children will identify and work to remove the physical, cognitive and social barriers by collaborating closely with the communities and particularly the influencers and gatekeepers. We will also address the intersectionality of vulnerability factors, for example women with disabilities or from minor clans who are likely to face multiple levels of discrimination.\nThe project will contribute to improving equitable access to quality life-saving curative and preventative health and nutrition services through the support of static health facilities complemented by mobile outreach services. There will be one integrated health and nutrition mobile team in Garowe district. The integrated health and nutrition mobile team will provide outpatient consultations, routine immunizations, maternal healthcare, disease surveillance and health promotion as well as systematic identi\ufb01cation, referral and treatment of acutely malnourished cases by providing integrated nutrition services to out-patient therapeutic programme (OTP), Targeted Supplementary Feeding Program (TSFP) and stabilization centers. The provision of OTP services for those with Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) and the referral and treatment of SAM cases with medical complications to the nearest stabilization centre. Micronutrient supplementation, promotion of Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF) practices, promotion of adoption of good hygiene and sanitation practices will be done, providing treatment for all age groups, both male and female. The health and nutrition interventions will improve early identification and prevention of malnutrition, and access to primary health care, and therefore reduce excess morbidity and mortality. As part of gender and social norms transformation we will ensure that the activities include positive messaging for men in their roles as fathers. Women and girls will be seen by health practitioners of the same sex and consultations and documentation will be kept confidential.\nSave the Children (SC) will support nine fixed facilities in the following locations Waabari MCH, Gabmbool MCH, Gargar MCH, Jilab MCH, Barwaaqo MCH,Bahnano 1 MCH, Bahnano 2 MCH, Hanano MCH and Awrculus MCH    with integrated health and nutrition services in addition to the mobile and iCCM services. SC will carry out regular safety audits of the facilities to identify and mitigate the risks faced by women and girls in accessing services and resources.\nWe would like to note that Save the Children is working closely with partners to monitor and respond to the ongoing COVID 19 pandemic and will plan to modify and adapt programme activities according to the emerging situation if necessary. Save the Children will be considering the four following dimensions and is currently developing plans for staff health, business continuity, programme preparedness and programme response.",

        "title": "Providing Integrated Health and WASH services to marginalized and vulnerable IDP and Host communities in Burdhubo",
        "description": "Trocaire has been the main provider of Health services in Gedo since 1992, operating all main hospitals in northern Gedo in partnership with District Health Boards and, more recently, the Ministry of Health. This proposed intervention will provide integrated lifesaving Health and WASH services to 3,987 men, 3,767 women, 3,588 boys, and 3,404 girls from Burdhubo location in Garbaharey district. These will include approximately 7,373 IDPs, 7,373 host community members, and 730 individuals with different forms of disability. Trocaire will work closely with the government District Medical Officers, the Burdhubo District Health Board, the District Commissioner's office, other implementing partners and with coordination through the Health and WASH clusters. Coordination will be prioritized as it remains a key assumption of the project for effective and efficient delivery of integrated lifesaving assistance to vulnerable and marginalized populations in Burdhubo. Health interventions aim to provide primary and essential lifesaving services in an inclusive manner. With a few private health facilities in Burdhubo, the population remains under-served, with children, pregnant and lactating mothers facing unimaginable challenges as they walk long distances of up to 40 kilometres to access health services. Trocaire will therefore work with the above stakeholders to re-establish affordable, accessible, and inclusive health services to both vulnerable IDP and host communities. This will require minor rehabilitation of 1 static health facility- Burdhubo Health Centre, and equipment and management of 1 mobile outreach team that will access beneficiaries in 5 outreach sites. Waiting shades will be constructed in these five sites to ensure dignified assistance is provided in a safe, accessible environment. Health workers will be trained to handle different components of health activities including Clinical Management of Rape, immunizations, emergency trauma care, communicable disease treatment, TB screening and treatment etc. Specialized services, which require referral to nearby hospitals, will be facilitated. The Trocaire-managed health facility in Garbaharey town will be the main referral point, as it is equipped as a referral hospital.\nWASH services will complement health services through relations with the health outreach teams, working closely to reduce morbidity and mortality rates, as well as reducing cases of malnutrition. Preventive approaches will be utilized through 11 hygiene promotion sessions with community-based staff/ volunteers. Hand-washing practices will be promoted through distribution of 1,000 hygiene kits through restricted cash vouchers in collaboration with the WASH cluster hub, as well as other partners on the ground, if any. According to assessment data collected in early March 2020, about 90 percent of the population in Burdhubo use untreated and unsafe water from the river, which is also too far a distance for most of the HHs. Within this project, Trocaire will seek to construct one hybrid shallow well with water treatment encouraged at the household level to encourage uptake of safe and clean water. One representative Water-User Management Committees (WMCs) will be set up to manage the shallow wells created. 70 emergency latrines will be constructed and hand-washing facilities with soap installed. Hygiene promotion sessions will be held. Trocaire is discussing with other partners to ensure that once this project is operational there will be opportunities to continue implementing necessary services, and working closely with the local, regional and national stakeholders to ensure that they are well equipped to continue provision of these services, when time is right for Trocaire to exit.",

Children with moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) will be referred to the TFSP, while those with uncomplicated severe acute malnutrition (SAM) will be referred to the OTP run by SUADO. Complicated cases of SAM will be treated in the stabilization centre (SC) in Jalalaqsi. Tracing of children that have defaulted from the SC programme will be established and carried out by the SC teams. Provision of therapeutic and supplementary feeding for malnourished children lt5 and PLW will be provided during the programme period. Children not progressing well under treatment will be visited at home for counselling for their mothers. \nMercy-USA will ensure that nutrition site will receive uninterrupted therapeutic/supplementary food supplies. Mercy-USA will secure agreements with WFP and UNICEF before the start of the program. Mercy-USA will provide staff, technical capacity building for staff and additional monitoring to ensure compliance with nutrition protocols. \nMercy-USA will train all nutrition staff on SAM and MAM diagnosis and management. Mercy-USA will provide regular joint supervision of the health facilities with MoH and provide refresher trainings for staff.\nThis programme will promote optimal nutrition and IYCF practices that are beneficial to child survival and development by focusing on the promotion, support and protection of EBF for children and appropriate complementary feeding to build resilience and the nutrition status of infants lt6 months (through EBF) and children 6-24 months. Mothers with children lt6 months will receive messages specific to Exclusive Breastfeeding while mothers with children 6-24 months will receive messages on breastfeeding and complementary feeding. \nScreening for malnutrition among children lt5 and PLW will be conducted primarily at the community level, though this screening will also occur at the health facilities by nutrition staff. Malnourished women and children will be admitted in the relevant OTP or TSFP programme. \nChildren in the nutrition programme will receive relevant micronutrient supplementation such as iron/folate and Vitamin A according to IMAM guidelines. Women in prenatal care will receive treatment for anaemia if required as well as micronutrient supplementation, and postnatal women will be supplemented with Vitamin A and treatment of anaemia if required. Additionally, all children admitted in the nutrition programme will receive deworming drugs. In addition, children in the nutrition programme will receive relevant89` micronutrient supplementation such as iron/folate and Vitamin A according to Somalia IMAM guidelines. \nSerious vaccine-preventable diseases are still prevalent in Somalia. Mercy-USA will thus support provision of routine EPI activities. This will continue to increase immunization coverage among women and children lt5 years. Nomadic groups and remote or difficult to access communities are most at risk of missing out on routine EPI. Therefore, Mercy-USA will facilitate outreach EPI teams.",

        "description": "Evictions represent a unique protection challenge in Somalia with far-reaching consequences on physical security, dignity, and livelihood of victims. Bossosa is one of the epicenters of the problem as the region struggles to recover from the residual effects of the 2016-17 drought amid persistent insecurity, cyclic natural disasters, and widespread unlawful evictions. At the national level, Somalia is faced with the daunting prospect of rebuilding the country having been riven by more than two decades of conflict and lawlessness. Important strides are being made to address the issue but ongoing initiatives have been outmatched due to the prevalence of the problem, thus necessitating a more robust, integrated and coordinated program response. In the absence of an effective response to address protection challenges that are being exacerbated by eviction, displaced communities will remain at risk of continuing secondary displacements. Efforts to strengthen protection and contribute to durable solutions to displacement in Bossaso will be incomplete and/or undermined without addressing the issue of eviction concurrently and systematically. The project seeks to contribute towards ensuring that individuals affected by displacement receive support assistance to improve their tenure security situation and address post-eviction complications.\n\nThis action builds on NRC\u2019s hands on expertise in evictions prevention and response programming in Somalia, and targeting 37,198 individuals in Bossaso, the project seeks to enhance the protection of displaced communities at risk of eviction and to create an enabling environment for sustained recovery and the pursuit of log lasting solutions. This overarching objective will be achieved by implementing a combination of complementary activities aimed at reducing the practice of unlawful evictions, strengthening tenure security among displaced communities at highest risk of eviction, and consolidating the protection of HLP rights. Priority actions include supporting the establishment of dedicated evictions prevention capacities at the municipality of Bossaso, replicating eviction programming best practices at the municipality, helping victims cope with post-eviction stress through cash, and strengthening local dispute resolution capacities and fostering social cohesion in target communities. A parallel objective of the HLP Sub Cluster which this project will seek to advance is consolidating HLP capacity among national organization.\n\nA combination of deliverables will contribute toward the mitigation of protection risks exacerbated by evictions through integrated prevention and response initiatives ensuring that displaced communities have increased access to information and specialized services necessary to navigate administrative and procedural obstacles linked to the enjoyment and exercise of HLP rights and supporting local mechanisms to address HLP violations and contribute to social cohesion.",

To achieve this overarching goal, lifesaving response to most vulnerable communities living in underserved and hard to reach areas in Xudur district. Protection services are combined with tangible assistance packages to assist displacement affected communities to develop resilient capacities necessary to address protection issues affecting women and children. Implementation will follow a linear integration approach where NRC will work in close collaboration with other partners to complement broader humanitarian objectives in Xudur. Specific priorities include strengthening community protection mechanisms to create an overall enabling protective environment, informing humanitarian interventions through periodic protection analysis, fostering peaceful co-existence through dialogues, providing direct emergency protection assistance to persons in need, contributing to improved referral systems, facilitating physical and material safety through the distribution of dignity kits, solar lanterns and the rehabilitation of solar street lights in high-risk areas. A total of 15,428 individuals are targeted across the 18 IDP sites in Xudur.\n\nLocal authorities estimate that there are about 5,000 IDP HHs in Xudur, majority of whom arrived as result 2016-17 droughts and ongoing conflicts. According to joint assessments conducted by NRC, AVORD and NRC in March 2020, the humanitarian situation in Xudur is dire and require immediate attention. Generally, Xudur faces serious humanitarian challenges as the district cannot be easily accessed by humanitarian actors safe for a small radius of about 25kms from the main town. Al Shabaab operations remain high and the security situation is in unpredictable. The already congested IDP sites are receiving new influx on daily basis burdening the already fragile. Water, Protection, Shelter and security issues were the greatest needs among the IDPs and displacement affected communities. Almost 80% of the IDPs have lost their assets as well as means of livelihood such as farming and livestock and are unwilling to return their places of origins. Water supply and sanitation services are needed, only 1/3 of the population have access to the already overwhelmed sanitation services, while over 70% of go out for open deifications. Hygiene essentials and practices are absent. It is within this context that the current project was conceptualized.",

        "description": "The proposed project will support three existing GBV one stop centers and three safe spaces in Sool to ensure sustained provision of GBV services for survivors and will also support referral pathways for service provision. This is a comprehensive Gender Based Violence (GBV) project that attacks the root causes of GBV in Emergencies through mitigating the risk of GBV occurring in IDP and within the host communities of Laas Caanood, Taleex and Dharkein ganyo and provides multi-sectorial services to survivors of GBV through community based programming and strengthening of GBV response systems and promoting community cohesiveness which will promote community-based protection mechanism by ensuring women, men, girls and boys participate in community-based protection mechanisms/sessions. The primary modalities for delivering service will be through the scaling up of direct service provision to GBV survivors using integrated referral pathways for clinical management of rape, service mobilization through women and girls\u2019 safe spaces. Some of the key activities include: Improving access to rape services for GBV survivors Providing comprehensive services including GBV case management, legal aid, psychological first aid/support accompanied with referral for appropriate services capacity building of actors, medical support, facilitate access to legal services through referrals, provision of dignity kits and solar lanterns, access to psycho-social support through counseling to GBV survivors, facilitate referral to ensure access to appropriate services. This approach incorporated harmonized approach to access services through both preventive and response mechanism. The response measures shall enhance access to referral for medical support, access legal support by making referral to other partner organizations, access to dignity kits to the survivors and also to women and girls at risk of GBV, solar lanterns and psycho social support. This shall therefore increase accessibility to quality and coordinated GBV services for conflict affected communities in Laas Caanood, Taleex and Dharkein Ganyo and strengths resilience among the vulnerable populations including Internal Displaced Population (IDPs) and poor host community through awareness. TASS will also undertake a comprehensive mapping of existing referral pathways for GBV survivors on how they can access to the services and challenges in remote target locations and maintain monitoring and reporting of GBV incidents for prevention and response actions. While implementing the activities we will work closely and use the existing structures to strengthen the coordination with stakeholders/clusters, partners and government structures and /or women and girls\u2019 friendly spaces and avenues. TASS shall ensure confidentiality in reporting and also referral mechanism through its qualified and professional staff who will improve services accessibility to women and girls in target locations and provide comprehensive services",

As part of lessons learnt in late 2019 during which Somalia has experienced one of the most devastating floods in history, AVORD will ensure that relief items are readily available for immediate distribution to affected households, as needed. \n\nUnder the proposed initiative, 5,650 NFI kits will be distributed to stressed communities in humanitarian crisis in Baidoa including the newly arrived and evicted households. The target group include 8,136 men, 10,848 women, 4,068 boys and 4,068 girls from the IDP community and 2,034 men, 2,712 women, 1,017 boys and 1,017 girls from host communities. Of the target group, an estimated 1,017 men, 1,356 women, 508 boys and 509 girls will be targeted based on disability. In-line with shelter cluster standards, each NFI kits will contain critical relief items such as 1 Plastic Sheet, 3 Blankets, 2 Sleeping Mats, 1 Kitchen Set, 1 double Mosquito Net, 1 Solar lamp and 2 Jerrycan with the capacity of 10 liters each. Where market conditions allow based on survey data, AVORD will adapt a Cash-based approach to implementation otherwise, an in-kind, direct distribution modality will be adapted. Disbursement of relief items will be made in close coordination with the shelter cluster to ensure that available stocks are used to respond to crisis and that activities contribute to the attainment of cluster strategic objectives. In each distribution, priority will be given to most vulnerable households in humanitarian emergency including the disabled, the chronically-ill, female headed households and families with the largest number of children under the age of 5. Full beneficiary details such as contact information will be captured throughout the process to facilitate monitoring activities and ensure that aid is given to those in need. Within 4 to 8 weeks of each distribution, a Post Distribution Monitoring Exercise (PDM) will be conducted to assess the effectiveness of the response and document lessons learnt. \n\nIn the delivery of the proposed package, AVORD will seek integration with own interventions in the region and with other humanitarian partners including NRC and DRC with whom AVORD has signed a memorandum of cooperation, to ensure complementarity, value for money and efficiency of the response.",

The target population (women, girls, men, boys, elderly and people with disabilities) living in the IDP site reside in small makeshift structures made of sub-standard materials that jeopardize their physical security, privacy, and from vagaries of nature and diseases. \n\nUnder this project, HAPEN will distribute 3954 NFIs and 3954 ESKs as in-kind to 9 IDP site in Gedo region Dollow: (Kabasa = 655, Qansahley = 550, Host 100), Luuq: Jazeera =314, Xero kowad= 470 and Boyle=420 Host =100), and Garbahrey: (Towfiq =270, Tula qorah =345, Hashi Weer =380, Tafta taag =250 and Host 100).\n\nBeneficiaries will be selected through a participatory process driven by a representative project and site management committees while ensuring marginalized groups interests are catered for and vulnerable approach, considering issues such as women-headed and child-headed households, orphans, disabled, the old among and new arrivals, protracted, and distribution.\n\nThe proposed intervention targets 3654 IDP HHs (21,924 IDP persons) and 300 IDP host HHs (1,800) in Dollow, Garbaharey and Luuq. The protracted IDPs targeted are those living in Grabahrey. These families belong to most vulnerable IDPs who live in makeshift buuls without adequate access to NFIs and Emergency Shelter. \n\nFollowing a need-based and transparent selection of beneficiaries and on local market conditions, HAPEN will facilitate a direct-distribution program through which targeted IDPs and select host communities will receive ESKs and NFIs. HAPEN will employ an owner-driven approach in the construction of emergency shelters by capacitating the IDPs to undertake the construction process.\n\nProtection and GBV concerns will be factored during site selection and will be integrated in all aspects of the response. Proper site planning will be undertaken to ensure effective mitigation of hazards and reduce alarming congestion levels in target settlements.\n\nOn monitoring and evaluation, Post Distribution Monitoring (PDM) and Post Construction Monitoring (PCM) will be conducted after distribution and construction respectively. Therefore, two PDM exercises will be conducted for the two phases of NFI distributions. The monitoring exercise will provide beneficiary feedback on the effectiveness and collate lessons of the distribution. 90% of the beneficiaries will take part in the exercise to ensure proper representation and accurate reflection on the process and quality of the intervention. \n\nThe PDM will support measuring beneficiary satisfaction of the items distributed and identify the needs and feelings of the community better. The exercises will inform on the effectiveness of the activities and achievements of targets while providing guidance towards the overall objective. \n\n3 Community Response and Feedback Mechanism (CRFM) desks, one for each district of operation will be established, in addition to the hotline and PDM /PCM.

        "description": "This project is intended to address the emergency shelter and NFIs needs of 2,216 IDP families (13,296 persons) of newly conflict and flood affected population as well as the most vulnerable protracted IDP families for life-saving in both districts \u2013 Afgoye and Marka \u2013 Lower Shabelle region.  With the presence of the Somali National Army (SNA) and AMISOM, Al Shabab, and clan militia, the security situation in the region had become more volatile than it was before. Security operations carry out by SNA and AMISOM alongside the USA drone airstrike targeting Alshabaab Militia caused humanitarian consequences to the civilians in the region. Within March 2020, joint forces SNA/AMISOM took over Janale village as a strategic business center it is about 13KM to Marka district. As a result, an estimated number of 3,200 HHs mainly women, children, and elderly people have fled from Janale to the IDPs in Marka, Afgoye villages as well as Mogadishu to escape from the violence. \nThus, based on findings from rapid needs assessment through direct surveys of IDPs in Marka villages and telephone interviews with IDPs in Afgoye villages conducted by HINNA team in the region, this project is assigned to address emergency shelter and NFIs needs of 2,216 IDP families (13,296 people) of the newly conflict and flood affected population including those protracted IDP families who have recently received any shelter and NFIs assistance in 10 IDP sites in the areas with high severity and people in need \u2013 5 in Afgoye namely Aytire, Baalguri, Damaley, Sagaalaad, and Mareereey and 5 in Marka namely Buulo Samoow, Buufoow Bacaad, Moallin Ali, Abukar Same, and Cell Fareey who are in dire need of shelter and NFIs assistance as they live in bushes that endanger their lives and dignity. During beneficiary registration, the project will give more priority to most vulnerable and marginalized groups such as IDPs with larger families, families with disabled and elderly persons, female headed-households and etc.\nAlthough markets in both districts are functioning the main challenge is that IDP settlements are far from them. However, according to the preference of project target IDP community including existing camp management committees, camp leaders and local authorities who participated in consultation meeting conducted through direct observation and phone interviews about the modality of assistance, this project will use in-kind distribution modality of 2,216 ESKs and 2,216 NFIs to project direct target beneficiaries of 2,216 HHs (13,296 persons) in both districts. In the context of COVID 19, decongestion and site planning/rearranging shelters will be considered in consultation with IDP communities and in close coordination with the cluster. \nDuring the implementation, the project will ensure using cluster guidelines to improve the living condition of the targeted beneficiaries by restoring their privacy, protection, and dignity. Post Distribution Monitoring (PDM) will be conducted four to six weeks after to assess the quality of the distribution and process, utilization, and its immediate impact in saving lives and the satisfaction of beneficiaries about the NFI items distributed and/or the shelters constructed and it's quality. This will help us know more about the future preference of IDP communities.\nThe main objective of the project is to ensure that 13,296 persons (2,216 HHs) of newly displaced, and protracted IDPs affected by conflict and natural disasters have the protection from the weather and have privacy through the provision of 2,216 Emergency Shelter (ESKs) and 2,216 NFI kits to 2,216 households (13,296 persons: (1,728 men, 2,925 women, 3,324 boys, and 5,319 girls)). The project will ensure full coordination among humanitarian service provides especially shelter cluster partners who are working in the project areas in order to avoid duplications.",

As well as threatening species with extinction, IWT destroys vital ecosystems. IWT also fosters corruption, feeds insecurity, and undermines good governance and the rule of law. The UK government is committed to tackling illegal trade of wildlife products. Defra manages the Illegal Wildlife Trade Challenge Fund, which is a competitive grants scheme with the objective of tackling illegal wildlife trade and, in doing so, contributing to sustainable development in developing countries. Projects funded under the Illegal Wildlife Trade Challenge Fund address one, or more, of the following themes: \u2022 Developing sustainable livelihoods to benefit people directly affected by IWT \u2022 Strengthening law enforcement \u2022 Ensuring effective legal frameworks \u2022 Reducing demand for IWT products Over \u00a323 million has been committed to 75 projects since the Illegal Wildlife Trade Challenge Fund was established in 2013; five projects were awarded in 2014 (via applications to the Darwin Initiative), fourteen in 2015, fifteen in 2016, thirteen in 2017, fourteen in 2018 and in the latest round in 2019.

        "description": "The project aims at improving the capacity of public sector health and education institutions to provide quality services with special focus on vulnerable groups: women children and youth through skills and knowledge transfer by the Somali diaspora. The ov\nerall objective of the project is to contribute to stabilization in South Central Somalia and Puntland through increasing access to basic services (health and education) and creating employment opportunities for the youth including women. In addition young\n Somalis will be placed in internship positions under the supervision of the diaspora experts at relevant institutions. The project trains health and education sector professionals to produce quality public services in health and education and to administe\nr the resources of the sectors. The trainers are diaspora experts especially Finnish diaspora who work and share their expertise in the sectors.The Mid-Term Evaluation which was finalized in August 2018 showed that results have been gained in both health a\nnd education sectors. For example the intake of patients at Yardimeli Hospital in Mogadishu has increased significantly in a short period of time from around 800 patients in July 2017 to around 4000 in March 2018. Moreover the number of assisted births inc\nreased substantially. The diaspora experts placed at the Ministry of Education were successful in supporting the organizational reform and writing key strategic planning documents for the sector. According to the Mid-Term Evaluation the project was very re\nlevant in filling the gaps and specialized needs in the institutions. According to all participants both local and the diaspora the project was successful in producing sustainable results in skills and knowledge. The implementing partner is the Internation\nal Organisation for Migration (IOM). From 2015 to 2019 Finland has supported the project with 4 420 000 EUR. From 2019 to 2021 the total budget for the second phase funded by Finland is 5 400 000 EUR. The budget is disbursed as follows: 1 MEUR in 2019; 24 \nMEUR in 2020; 2 MEUR in 2021.",

Local health professionals have skills/capacity to deliver quality health services2.) Loc\nal health training institutions have improved competence and ability to train local health professionals 3.) Ministry of Health has increased capacity to steer manage and coordinate the health sector The Somali diaspora experts particularly the Finnish Som\nali diaspora experts are the actors in the capacity building efforts. They train the local health professionals and participate in developing strategies plans standards and curricula for health sector. Particular attention is given to women's and child hea\nlth. In the long term the project is expected to contribute to better health outcomes for Somaliland population and especially the health outcomes for women and children.The first Finnish funded MIDA project was initiated already in 2008. The project has b\neen evaluated twice and the findings suggest that the project has significantly strengthened public health institutions? ability to provide quality services in Somaliland. The findings and recommendations of evaluations have been duly notified in the plann\ning of the Finnsom IV phase: For example the project now focuses on the more remote regions in Somaliland where service provision is poorer than in the capital Hargeisa. Similarly following the recommendations the length of the assignments of diaspora expe\nrts has been increased for Phase IV.To support the implementation of the project the National Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) also implements tailored trainings for the Ministry of Health.The duration of the Phase IV is four years from March 2017 un\ntil August 2020.

        "title": "Fighting TB in Somalia: public-private partnerships and inclusive communities",
        "description": "The project is founded on PSR's previous projects in Somalia which have developed new strategies to tackle tuberculosis (TB) ? especially in community and private sector engagement. A special focus will be placed on women and vulnerable community members: \ndisabled persons IDPs and prisoners. Tuberculosis is a central health problem in Somalia. The increase of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a global threat ? fighting against MDR-TB in Somalia benefits all countries. Another central problem is \nthe low treatment coverage rate of about 37% leaving far too many cases untreated further transmitting tuberculosis to others. The impact targets of the project are to: a) tackle multi-drug resistant tuberculosis; and b) increase the tuberculosis case dete\nction rate. The long-term objective of the project is to contribute to the reduction of the tuberculosis burden in Somalia with the following means:1. Increase the access of women and vulnerable groups to TB services (such as disabled personsIDPs and priso\nners)2. Increase TB referrals from the private sector3. Improve the quality of TB treatment in both the public and private sector4. Improve the quality of TB laboratory work.The central partners of the project are the National Tuberculosis Programmes of So\nmaliland and Somalia. PSR has a central role in developing the national tuberculosis diagnostic infrastructure in Somalia. The project will support the National TB Reference Laboratories in Somaliland and South-Central Somalia as well as will treatment of \ntuberculosis patients in 3 clinics in Hargeisa and Mogadishu. These clinics will develop innovative community public and private sector engagement models to increase case detection improve treatment quality and to increase public awareness and decrease sti\ngma/discrimination. The clinics will also provide HIV services and nutritional support for malnourished patients (with WFP).Together with the local administration the tuberculosis clinics will be transformed into health centers providing specialized tuberc\nulosis services by the end of 2022 to support integration with basic health services and sustainability after the project has ended.",

Long-lasting conflict has damaged the health sector and due to shortage of professional staff and low financial resources especially the most vulnerable people continue to str\nuggle to receive quality healthcare. Since maternal healthcare services are not widely available majority of women don?t receive any professional healthcare during pregnancy and delivery which contributes to the high rates of maternal and infant mortality.\n Maternity Clinic and Training project has supported FinSom Maternity Clinic together with the local partner VMDSO in Afgoye Somalia since 2012. The Clinic provides maternal healthcare for thousands of women and treats about 20 000 outpatients annually. Th\ne Clinic is the only one in the area operating free of cost and open 24/7. In addition to maternal health services the project aims to increase the awareness of health-related issues in the local community such as FGM HIV/AIDS provide support for the victi\nms of gender-based violence through counseling and organize training to traditional birth attendants. Long-term goal of the project is to improve women's health in Afgoye and ensure women's access to quality maternal healthcare. Main beneficiaries of the p\nroject are the women receiving maternal healthcare and counseling at the Clinic and their children. Furthermore all the outpatients receiving care at the Clinic and people participating to the awareness raising are beneficiaries of the project. This includ\nes vulnerable groups such as IDPs and disabled women. The results of the previous project phases show that the Clinic is providing vital source of quality care both to expectant mothers and other members of the community. Raising awareness about health has\n been successful and majority of pregnant women and mothers treated at the Clinic report negative attitude towards FGM. The continuation phase invests further to increase the capacity of local partner Clinic's health personnel TBAs and volunteers through t\nraining so that in the future they could take over the management of the project and secure other sources of funding.",

        "description": "The project will support the Somali Health Authorities in 10 targeted districts (Abdiazir, Bondhere, Hamarweyne, Hodan, Shangani, Shibis, Waberi, Wadajir, Wardhigley, Yaqshid) in Banadir to: 1. Increase access to, utilisation and quality of health and nutrition services at community, primary and secondary health levels, especially for women, children and vulnerable populations and; 2. Strengthen the health system under the stewardship of the Somali Health Authorities (SHAs). The project\u2019s approach focuses on strengthening the SHAs\u2019 capacity at the regional, district and community levels to deliver the EPHS (core services 1-6). Lessons from Joint Health Nutrition Programme (JHNP) and other programmes, identified a critical management gap at the district level in Banadir. A core focus of the project\u2019s methodology is therefore to support the Regional health Officer (RHO) in Banadir to establish and develop a District Health Management Team (DHMT) in each of the 10-targeted districts. Having an operational management body at district level, within the SHA structure, will be an essential component of ensuring that the health facilities and community/female health workers (CHWs/FHWs), in their respective districts, are able to receive the technical, management and logistical support required for them to successfully deliver integrated, quality, health and nutrition services that the population can access. This is a structure and model that has been demonstrated to be successful in other health systems (e.g. in Kenya). The consortium will work closely with the RHO throughout the project to establish, develop and support the DHMTs.",

The main area of research and learning will be changes in access to services (access to health facilities in DRC and access to justice in Somalia) and how this contributes to conflict prevention and to inclusive peacebuilding processes.

The project addresses urgent needs for water and sanitation provision in rural and peri-urban areas affected by recurring droughts and waterborne diseases such as acute watery diarrhea and cholera. Indeed, the state of disrepair of water and sanitation infrastructure is a major factor contributing to significant outbreaks of water-borne diseases, particularly diarrhea whose incidence rate in Somalia is 21%. The interventions proposed under this project will therefore improve the quality of life of about 175,000 people and their livestock in rural Somalia. They are articulated around the following two operational components: 1) capacity building and 2) construction / rehabilitation of water supply and sanitation infrastructure for stability and resilience that will create about 1,300 jobs. In addition, the project will promote the use of water for multiple purposes, community mobilization campaigns and awareness of health and hygiene issues will be conducted, practices of nond\u00e9f\u00e9cation in the open, through the community-led total sanitation approach will also be promoted.

Water and Sanitation tariffs will be reviewed to incorporate lifeline tariffs, which often ensure that those in greatest hardship can afford water  and  sanitation  services.  Selected  education,  health and  market facilities  will  also  benefit  from improved water and sanitation facilities and  hygiene training and promotion.

This project directly contributes to Somalia\u2019s on-going recovery efforts and the measures to promote stability and inclusion through investment in strengthening the public works institutions towards effective delivery of basic services. It will improve the capacities of MPWR&H and State-level Authorities responsible for public works to enable them to independently plan, manage and oversee infrastructure construction projects and maintenance works. The former includes the ability of Public Works Authorities to work with all relevant stakeholders and ensure the involvement of local communities and other marginalized groups (e.g. women and the youth). The enhanced and certified expertise of youth achieved through the project\u2019s activities will lead to an increase of employment in the sector, result in higher household incomes and help rebuilt the country. The outlined project will help pave the way for a well capacitated and sovereign Somali government.",

The Program complements Somalia\u2019s efforts to advance its development agenda (consolidate peace, accelerate reductions in poverty and income inequality, catalyze needed financing for transformative growth generating infrastructure). It consists of two broad components namely: (i) strengthening domestic revenue mobilization and public financial management; and (ii) advancing financial sector development. The operation has been designed in anticipation of Somalia\u2019s arrears clearance, a process being undertaken by the United Kingdom (UK). It takes into account the need for the Bank to step up its re-engagement with Somalia, post-arrears clearance, and to support the country\u2019s on-going economic and financial reforms. The implementation of the reforms being supported by the program is expected to lead to high, sustainable and inclusive growth for Somalia. This operation is strongly coordinated with those of the WB and IMF.",

This is part of the Bank\u2019s continuous engagement with countries in fragile situation as well as a response to a specific request from the Federal Government of Somalia to support the government\u2019s state building efforts. The project will contribute to capacity enhancement in macroeconomic management through strengthened revenue and PFM institutions, as well as improving transparency and accountability for better public service delivery. It builds on the work of the previous financial governance projects, and aims to consolidate their achievements. Specific areas that will be maintained include support to debt management and budget preparation. The project has three mutually reinforcing components: (i) Strengthening macro-economic planning and management (ii) Enhancing control, transparency and accountability in the use of public resources, and (iii) strengthening capacity for project management. The expected outcomes are: (i) Enhanced domestic revenue mobilization which will be measured through increased revenue to GDP ratio, and; (ii) Improved fiscal space to increase share of budget allocated to social sectors. The project will be implemented over the period 2018-2020 with a total cost (exclusive of tax and customs duty) estimated at UA 5.5 million, including contingencies.",
