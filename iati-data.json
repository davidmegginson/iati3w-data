The project will also be developing community and institutional capacity to ensure support to girls\u2019 education is sustained in the longer term. EGEP saw significant progress regarding community members\u2019 expectations of girls about girls\u2019 education between baseline and midline. General support for girls\u2019 education increased by 27% across community members surveyed and the percentage of caregivers stating gender to be an important factor determining whether a child should go to school declined from 54% to 9%. Respondents frequently noted that community members themselves are engaging in awareness-raising activities. School enrolment increased by 20% and attendance increased by 5%, which suggests this positive shift in attitudes has led to positive results in school. Learning levels increased, however, they did not reach the intended targets. 37% of girls who enter secondary school have dropped out by Form 4. A contributing factor behind these less positive trends appears to be that the aspirations of caregivers and communities for girls\u2019 education can be at odds with the considerable expectations placed on girls in terms of traditionally assigned gender roles. EGEP conducted 70 FGDs with girls, asking them what the most critical challenges were that lead to girls\u2019 decreased participation in school in later grades: after economic factors, the most common response was early marriage, and the third most common response was household chores. Additionally, girls are often expected to prioritise care of siblings or contribution to household income over schooling and homework. These expectations intensify as the girl reaches adolescence. Furthermore, within the school, girls are not necessarily expected to achieve at the same level as boys, to hold leadership positions, and to complete the full education cycle.

Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are expected from June to September in parts of central Somalia, where livestock holdings are lowest, and in northeasternSomalia, where the economy is more dependent on livestock, seafood, and frankincense exports. The socioeconomic impacts of COVID-19have led to a 30-50 % decline in annual external remittances, an anticipated 25-35 % decline in annual livestock exports, lower labour demand, and above average imported staple food prices.\nBesides adverse weather conditions and conflict resulting in food insecurity and hunger, other prevailing challenges in the project areas Oxfam and partners Candlelight, Havoyoco and KAALO work are poor access to water and inadequate hygiene and sanitation conditions, as well as displacement. Against this backdrop,  the proposed activities aim at assisting both IDPs and host communities. Access to clean and safe water is a major area of concern in our intervention areas in Somaliland and Puntland.\nOur proposed activities focus on relieving the distress suffered by affected families, preventing their situation from getting worse and strengthening collective resilience mechanisms.

The system can be accessed free of charge through mobile phones for callers using a 3-digit shortcode.\n\nThe Somaliland hotline has registered more than 651,366 calls so far (as of 19 May), highlighting the thirst of people across Somaliland for accurate and reliable information on Covid-19.

Shaqodoon is highlighting common misinformation on Covid-19 gathered through calls as well as stats on calls, follow-up and regional origin of callers on dashboards which support the Ministry of Health and humanitarian partners in addressing needs in a timely manner. They also produce weekly dashboards to provide the Ministry of Health with an overview of calls, levels of (mis-)information per region and necessary follow-up.\n\nThis project would support Shaqodoon in extending the helplineservice in collaboration with the Ministries of Health for another 2 months until June/July, reaching a majority of the population in Puntland and Somaliland (at least 60% of the population) with accurate and timely information, guidance and symptoms checking, while at the same time ensuring call center staff and Ministry of Health officials receive adequate protection and safe programming support to deal with sensitive data and critical cases.

Awdal is one of the regions affected by COVID19 as it connects Somaliland to Djibouti. The majority of people are dependent pity trades, small scale irrigation, and livestock, most of these activities have been affected, and communities reported a reduction of income. Existing water supply sources are mainly powered by a diesel generator that are purchased from the tariffs collected from the users. Associated water tariffs are sky rocking as access to diesel has reduced as restrictions are imposed on public transport. Out of the many strategic water sources, two sources are selected, supplying water for villages affected by COVID19 in Somaliland. Oxfam will install a solar system for these wells, and the action will reduce the cost of water tariff and increase community use of water for different purposes include handwashing.\n# Build the capacity of the WASH committees managing the solarizedse water sources by providing necessary tools and training them on both technical skill and financial management. This action will be led by the ministry of water department of scheme management. As we mobilize for the two sources an additional two boreholes within the sameareas will also be invited for the training. These will help to maximize use of expert time, cover nearby villages with capacity building plan and increase value for money by targeting more with same budget.\n# Support Somaliland Ministry of Water Development to ministry of water to finalize   the design and construction for WASH facilities to be shared with all WASH Cluster members in Somaliland. The national WASH cluster has prioritized this action as per the request from ministry and Oxfam will contribute for this action. The budget will be used to cover some of the consultancy fees or provide expertise to help them finalize the work.\n# Provide safeprogramming training for WaSH committees, district administrations, women groups other key stakeholders including traditional leaders    .\n# Protection awareness raising including community discussions on protection impact to address stigma and promotion of the call centre hotline   (already operational) to increase access to covid19 services for affected communities    .\n# Government capacity building/strengthen social safety net system in Somaliland : we will build the capacity of the government to be able to lead and coordinate Somaliland safety net program.

The employment generating interventions from this programme also aim to augment the credibility of the FGS and build trust and confidence in local governance and security sector institutions while providing immediate peace dividends to vulnerable sub-sections of the population. As encouraged in the New Deal Compact, this joint youth employment programme is a frontline intervention of the FGS to achieve rapid results under Peace and State-building Goal (PSG) 4 (Economic Foundations), which identifies youth employment through job creation and skills development as one of the most important priority projects over the next two years. Creating growth and job opportunities are a crucial part of development assistance and Somalia is in urgent need of decent employment and income generation opportunities. The private sector is responsible for 90 percent of jobs in developing countries, making it an essential partner in the fight against poverty and the engine of innovation, investment and growth. There are many obstacles which stand in the way of private sector development, the mains ones being: unfavourable investment climate, infrastructure shortages, lack of access to finance, lack of skills development opportunities and weak linkages between supply and distribution chains. Tackling such constraints will create job opportunities for young Somali men and women. Therefore, the FGS, with the support of UN agencies, will undertake the following interventions in newly recovered areas and other government priority areas over the next 24 months.

The overall objective of the program is to strengthen the resilience of people and communities to crises, and their capacity to recover afterwards, and to reduce the risk that people and communities are affected by crises and disasters. A novelty of the new agreement period is that three country-projects (Afghanistan, DR Congo and Myanmar) are offered multiyear financing as they are protracted crises with a need for preidictable finansing to secure necessary resources and ensure predictability and contextspecific impact.\n\nFunds allocated for 2017 will be disbursed in two different payments, after signature of the agreement and after 1 September 2017, following approval of implementation of the action plan established by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies regarding internal management and control. Funds allocated for Ukraine and for a scaled up response in South Sudan (from a budget of 4,5 MSEK to13,5 MSEK) will be disbursed after the SRC has provided Sida with, and Sida's approval of, additional applications for these contexts, and after the SRC has demonstrated in written that the corruption case in Ukraine has been investigated and closed and after Sida's approval of the investigation and its recommendations. \n\nThe SRC is part of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement made up of 190 Red Cross and Red Crescent national societies, the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Federation (IFRC) and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). Sida provides support to the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement through two channels: the ICRC and the SRC. The SRC channels most of Sida's support to national societies, the IFRC and the ICRC and works in longterm partnership with forteen countries: Cameroon, DR Congo, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, DPRK, Myanmar, Iraq, Palestine, Syria, Yemen and Ukraine. \n\nThe SRC\u2019s strategic cooperation with partners within the movement - with other National Societies (NS), IFRC and the ICRC \u2013 is essential and gives the SRC the possibility to work at both global and local levels. The SRC is in addition considered to have systems, expertise and capacity to strengthen the local capacity of NS to predict and prevent disasters, as well as to contribute to rapid humanitarian assistance in sudden crises. The SRC has faced difficulties in demonstrating the humanitarian relevance of the Sida-funded programs as they are often situated between humanitarian action and long-term development. The SRC\u2019s new humanitarian strategy 2016-2019 does, however, put a greater focus on humanitarian operations and this new approach is reflected in the organisation\u2019s application 2017-2019. Several programmes with a long-term development focus have been removed in the application for funding from Sida, and new initiatives with a sharper humanitarian focus have been included, such as Yemen and Cameroon (programme targeting CAR refugees). It will be important to follow up on this positive direction towards a strengthened humanitarian relevance to the Sida-funded projects to ensure its continuation.\n\nSupport planned for 2017 includes long-term programs in various fields such as health, disaster prevention, resilience, sanitation, organizational development, volunteer development and planning, monitoring, evaluation and results (PMER). The support also includes regional support to the IFRC\u2019s different cluster- and regional offices in Africa, Asia and MENA. Thematic- and capacity enhancement support will in 2017 focus on disaster reduction, volunteering in conflict and disaster, water and sanitation, health, and gender and diversity. Through support in the form of Sida's Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM), the SRC will also be able to respond to rapid onsets of disasters. \n\nThe program proposal for 2017 includes:\nWEST- AND CENTRAL AFRICA REGIONAL SUPPORT: 1,3 MSEK\nCAMEROON: 2 MSEK\nDR CONGO: 5 MSEK \nEAST- AND SOUTH AFRICA REGIONAL SUPPORT: 2,1 MSEK\nEAST AFRICA CLUSTER (Nairobi): 2,5 MSEK\nSOMALIA: 4 MSEK \nSOUTH SUDAN: 13,5 MSEK\nSUDAN: 4 MSEK\nASIA PACIFIC REGIONAL SUPPORT: 5,8 MSEK\nAFGHANISTAN: 6,5 MSEK\nBANGLADESH: 6 MSEK\nDPRK: 4,5 MSEK\nMYANMAR: 4,5 MSEK \nMENA REGIONAL SUPPORT: 4,3 MSEK\nIRAQ: 7 MSEK\nPALESTINE: 3 MSEK\nSYRIA INCLUDING Lebanon och Jordan: 30 MSEK \nYEMEN: 4,5 MSEK \nUKRAINE: 5 MSEK\nCAPACITY- OCH METHOD SUPPORT: 7,9 MSEK \nRRM-SUPPORT: 40 MSEK\nSUPPORT FOR THE DREF: 500 000 SEK \nSPECIAL INTERVENTIONS/ICRC DELEGATES: 3,6 MSEK\n\nThe program proposal for 2018 includes:\nDR CONGO: 5 MSEK \nAFGHANISTAN: 6,5 MSEK\nMYANMAR: 4,5 MSEK \n\nThe program proposal for 2019 includes:\nDR CONGO: 5 MSEK \nAFGHANISTAN: 6,5 MSEK\nMYANMAR: 4,5 MSEK \n\nOut of Sida's initial support for 2017 totalling 167.5 MSEK, 61.4 % (103.5 MSEK) will be channelled to the IFRC and 2.6 % (4,5 MSEK) to the ICRC.

expertise concerning ICT for development at Sida's initiative and was initially housed by the Royal Institute of Technology and later by Stockholm University, which is Sida's agreement partner. Sida has since continued to provide a multi-year non-earmarked support to SPIDER. SPIDER acts as the Swedish operational counterpart and advisor for a number of Sida\u2019s ICT for development (ICT4D) projects in countries prioritized by Sida. SPIDER mobilizes a network of Swedish and international experts in the area of information and communications technology (ICT) for development to help developing countries use ICT as a tool to efficiently and strategically drive development and poverty reduction goals - in this case, in the area of health. The proposed initiative aims to establish a National Health Management Information System (HMIS) in Somalia. There is no such initiative currently in the country. Establishing an effective HMIS is included in WHO's six basic building blocks for health systems. Current fragmentation and lack of data and information make it difficult, if not impossible, for Somali healthcare providers to plan, manage and deliver quality healthcare across the country in a cost-effective manner.\n\nSPIDER proposes an initial 12-month start-up phase during which SPIDER will conduct a review of the current data and information situation and capacity in Somalia, analysis of regional needs, including an assessment of the health system in the two selected regions (Galmudug and Puntland), recruitment and posting of project staff and mapping of relevant stakeholder. The two selected regions were determined by SPIDER in consultation with the Federal Ministry of Health in Somalia. The two selected regions reflect the current healthcare system in Somalia. The Galmudug region represents one of the weakest health systems with limited capacity and reach. The Galumudug region is also partially controlled by Al-Shabaab, which makes it difficult to access critical maternal and child health care. The Puntland region, on the other hand, has one of the most developed health systems in Somalia's federal government. The region is quite stable, and the Ministry of Health has sufficient capacity and experience compared to Galmudug. SPIDER also proposes to create a central hub for data storage and management in Mogadishu. Lessons learned from the first introductory phase will guide decisions to scale up the initiative to other regions. In summary, the project aims to design, establish and deliver a health information management system for that is suitable for Somalia's infrastructure and public health needs. The development of HMIS is an important issue for the federal government and is included among seen health care priorities.", "active": true, "orgs": {"implementing": ["University, college or other teaching institution, research institute or think-tank"], "programming": ["SIDA", "Stockholms universitet"], "funding": ["SIDA"]}, "sectors": {"dac": ["Health"], "humanitarian": ["Health"]}, "locations": {"unclassified": [], "admin2": [], "admin1": [], "countries": ["SO"]}, "dates": {"start": "2019-11-01", "end": "2023-06-30"}, "modalities": [], "targeted": {}}, {"identifier": "SE-0-SE-6-13241A0101-SOM-22030", "source": "IATI", "reported_by": "Sweden", "humanitarian": false, "title": "IMS/FOJO Media support in Somalia phase II", "description": "International Media Support (IMS) and Fojo Media Institute have submitted a programme proposal of 60 000 161 SEK stretching over 2019-2022 with the objective \"...to continue the long-term, systematic transformation and professionalisation of the Somali media landscape in strategic alignment with the values and practices of freedom of expression and media independence as key pillars of democratic state building processes based on rule of law and human rights\".\n\nThis will be done by focusing on three main outcomes relating to conducive, safe and gender equal working environment for journalists, the production and dissemination of high-quality public interest content and inclusive public dialogue and discussion.

Das stimmt mit den Forderungen im Marshallplan mit Afrika \"Afrika und Europa - Neue Partnerschaft f\u00fcr Entwicklung, Frieden und Zukunft\" \u00fcberein. Der Ansatz zielt auf die Verbesserung sozialer und produktiver Infrastruktur und ist multisektoral, sodass Ma\u00dfnahmen in den Bereichen Transport, Wasser- und Sanit\u00e4rversorgung, M\u00fcllentsorgung, Bildung und Gesundheit m\u00f6glich sind. In Mogadischu wurden bereits Ma\u00dfnahmen im Bereich kommunale Infrastruktur identifiziert, f\u00fcr die St\u00e4dte Kismayo, Baidoa und Garowe wurden Vorstudien erstellt. Die einzelnen Ma\u00dfnahmen werden im Rahmen der Umsetzung festgelegt. \u0152 \u0152Zur Planung und Umsetzung der o.g. Ma\u00dfnahmen werden die Strukturen des Multi Partner Fund der Weltbank (MPF) genutzt, der zur Umsetzung der FZ-Mittel ein gesondertes Finanzierungsfenster f\u00fcr st\u00e4dtische Infrastruktur einrichtet. Zur F\u00f6rderung des von der Gebergemeinschaft angestrebten \"State-Building\" werden somalische Regierungsstrukturen soweit wie m\u00f6glich in die Planung, Gestaltung und Umsetzung der Ma\u00dfnahmen eingebunden.
