With GAC\u2019s support, the World Food Programme (WFP), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) is working jointly to respond to food assistance needs in protracted crises. Project activities include: (1) responding to immediate food needs of specific beneficiaries, especially women and children; (2) restoring livelihoods; (3) protecting assets; and (4) preventing negative coping behaviors that contribute to food insecurity. This combination of activities is crucial to building resilience of populations, eventually decreasing dependence on humanitarian food assistance.",

The project addresses urgent needs for water and sanitation provision in rural and peri-urban areas affected by recurring droughts and waterborne diseases such as acute watery diarrhea and cholera. Indeed, the state of disrepair of water and sanitation infrastructure is a major factor contributing to significant outbreaks of water-borne diseases, particularly diarrhea whose incidence rate in Somalia is 21%. The interventions proposed under this project will therefore improve the quality of life of about 175,000 people and their livestock in rural Somalia. They are articulated around the following two operational components: 1) capacity building and 2) construction / rehabilitation of water supply and sanitation infrastructure for stability and resilience that will create about 1,300 jobs. In addition, the project will promote the use of water for multiple purposes, community mobilization campaigns and awareness of health and hygiene issues will be conducted, practices of nond\u00e9f\u00e9cation in the open, through the community-led total sanitation approach will also be promoted.

Cette composante se concentre sur l'\u00e9tablissement, la dotation en personnel et l'\u00e9quipement de l'Unit\u00e9 de strat\u00e9gie \u00e9conomique (ESU) sous l'autorit\u00e9 du ministre des finances. Six (6) experts en la mati\u00e8re (\u00e9conomistes, analyste financier, analyste fiscal, gestion des d\u00e9penses et affaires intergouvernementales) seront recrut\u00e9s dans le cadre du projet. Les principales activit\u00e9s de l'ESU propos\u00e9e consisteront \u00e0 fournir des conseils d'experts au ministre des finances, \u00e0 renforcer la coordination entre les fonctions de finances et de planification, et \u00e0 coordonner la mise en \u0153uvre des diverses actions dans les minist\u00e8res et agences gouvernementales n\u00e9cessaires pour atteindre les objectifs de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence dans le cadre des programmes de suivi du personnel. (ii) Am\u00e9liorer les comp\u00e9tences pour le d\u00e9veloppement des infrastructures. Ce volet est ax\u00e9 sur le renforcement des comp\u00e9tences de la Somalie en mati\u00e8re d'\u00e9tudes en amont n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 la mise en \u0153uvre de projets d'infrastructure, notamment le programme de corridors. Ce travail s'inspirera et s'appuiera sur les conclusions des \u00e9valuations des besoins du secteur des transports (TSNA) pour la Somalie, qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 command\u00e9es et parrain\u00e9es par la Banque. Ces \u00e9tudes en amont seront ax\u00e9es sur des travaux de r\u00e9habilitation cibl\u00e9s pour : La route Belet Weyne-Galkayo-Garowe (y compris la liaison entre Belet Weyn et Ferfer (fronti\u00e8re entre la Somalie et l'\u00c9thiopie)) ; Luuq, la route Ganane-Dolow, et ; la route Galkayo-Hobyo. (iii) Gestion du projet : Cette composante comprend des activit\u00e9s de suivi et d'\u00e9valuation, un audit externe et des activit\u00e9s de gestion de projet.",

The Program complements Somalia\u2019s efforts to advance its development agenda (consolidate peace, accelerate reductions in poverty and income inequality, catalyze needed financing for transformative growth generating infrastructure). It consists of two broad components namely: (i) strengthening domestic revenue mobilization and public financial management; and (ii) advancing financial sector development. The operation has been designed in anticipation of Somalia\u2019s arrears clearance, a process being undertaken by the United Kingdom (UK). It takes into account the need for the Bank to step up its re-engagement with Somalia, post-arrears clearance, and to support the country\u2019s on-going economic and financial reforms. The implementation of the reforms being supported by the program is expected to lead to high, sustainable and inclusive growth for Somalia. This operation is strongly coordinated with those of the WB and IMF.",

This is part of the Bank\u2019s continuous engagement with countries in fragile situation as well as a response to a specific request from the Federal Government of Somalia to support the government\u2019s state building efforts. The project will contribute to capacity enhancement in macroeconomic management through strengthened revenue and PFM institutions, as well as improving transparency and accountability for better public service delivery. It builds on the work of the previous financial governance projects, and aims to consolidate their achievements. Specific areas that will be maintained include support to debt management and budget preparation. The project has three mutually reinforcing components: (i) Strengthening macro-economic planning and management (ii) Enhancing control, transparency and accountability in the use of public resources, and (iii) strengthening capacity for project management. The expected outcomes are: (i) Enhanced domestic revenue mobilization which will be measured through increased revenue to GDP ratio, and; (ii) Improved fiscal space to increase share of budget allocated to social sectors. The project will be implemented over the period 2018-2020 with a total cost (exclusive of tax and customs duty) estimated at UA 5.5 million, including contingencies.",

The project will seek to improve the retention of already enrolled children living in flood-affected areas into the quality and inclusive basic education in a safe and protective learning environment. \n\nThe project will target and support 8,750 children (40% girls) in 20 schools, the most affected schools will be selected in coordination with regional coordinators will receive light rehabilitation and furnishing of desks and chairs, provision of teaching and learning materials to 8,750 learners from 20 schools, provision of dignity kits to 2000 adolescent girls to enhance their daily school attendance, provision of recreational materials to 20 schools that are tailored to the needs of children, Provision of community-based psychosocial support in schools, the establishment of 20 temporary child-friendly spaces (CFS) that will support the provision of PSS, recreational activities and non-formal education activities. On the protection front, the project will identify specific protection needs, inform service provision and serve as an entry point for specialized service provision with boys and girls. Targeted psychosocial support, psychological first aid, case management, and emergency referrals will be provided to child survivors of rights violations, Unaccompanied and Separated Children (UASC), and children who show signs of trauma. 500 children will be targeted for IDTR and PSS provided, of which 30% expected to be reunified with their families. \n\nThe proposed intervention will create synergies with existing programs focusing on child protection. The caseworkers and monitors in the present proposal will act as a reference for the referral pathways aiming at connecting services in the communities. Before starting the implementation, HIWA will coordinate with Shelter, protection, WASH, and CCCM to ensure complementarity and reinforcement of the project approach. HIWA has a strong experience in child protection in emergency and in resilience context and has previously implemented child protection programs funded by UNICEF in Beletweyne and Buula Burte, through this experience HIWA has established linkages with community leaders, local authorities and camp leaders making access and acceptance easier in the target locations. HIWA will coordinate with the regional education cluster during the implementation of the project. Coordination with WASH cluster will be essential in implementing the project, HIWA will work closely with Wash partner who will carry out hygiene promotion in schools and also ensure the water sources in the schools are safe.\n\nOpportunities for cross-sectoral collaboration within and beyond the HIWA education and protection sectors will be sought. The collaboration will include emergency operations with cluster partners to ensure a comprehensive approach and view of education and child protection. HIWA will use the strength of its relationship with the regional education and protection clusters to share information and collaborate in service provision to avoid duplication of activities in the selected schools. Before implementation starts, HIWA will liaise with the regional coordination structure to identify schools that have not been targeted by other partners. HIWA will also closely work with Relief International and Qatar foundation on hygiene promotion and other WASH interventions. Referrals will be directed to them where WASH needs are identified in different schools.",

        "description": "The rains that have inundated parts of Somalia are expected to continue in November with moderate to heavy intensity, according to the FAO Managed Somalia Water and Land Information Management (SWALIM). Heavy rains of more than 100mm are expected in Hiraan, Bay and Bakool regions which are already saturated following weeks of continued heavy rains. In South West State, an estimated 70,000 people have been affected and another 40,000 displaced by flash flooding across the region. Berdale town (60 km west of Baidoa) is worst affected. Three quarters of the town is submerged. Local authorities and humanitarian partners estimate that 30,000 people have been affected. The road to Berdale is impassable. Humanitarian partners are working with authorities to scale up the response in the affected areas INTERSOS is targeting to provide emergency lifesaving integrated health and nutrition services to the floods affected population in Berdale by establishing four mobile clinics and fixed facility supported by a network of community volunteers. \n\nHEALTH: The proposed project will support 4 Mobile Clinics and one fixed facility in Berdale district with the aim to deliver an integrated package of promotive, preventive and curative services through facility-based and community-based care. Specifically, general consultations, ANC/PNC/Delivery and basic life-saving treatment for those who suffer from common diseases such as AWD/ Cholera, malaria, respiratory tract infections, Routine immunization for children and pregnant mothers. The Mobile Clinics will work with a network of community volunteers in IDPs and host community to improve community sensitization and referral of severe cases and pregnant mothers to the MCH for safe delivery and neonatal care. The CVs/clinical staffs will be provided CP/GBV mainstreaming training to strengthen the referral cases of GBV survivors and clinical management in coordinating with the protection team for Psycho-social Support (PSS) and case management.   \n\nNUTRITION: The proposed  activities will be integrated with the health interventions with an aim to address the underlying causes of high levels malnutrition as well as to enable early identification for screening in targeted IDPs for floods affected population in Berdale district. This program will establish a strong community network through competent CNVs for early detection and referral of children, PLWs with acute malnutrition for active ongoing nutrition services provided by other partners. IYCF counseling will be provided at community in outreach and facility level for effective mobilization on the optimal nutritional feeding to under five children.\n\nINTERSOS is the focal point for Berdale flood response in collaboration with all partners and cluster leads for distribution of hygiene kits, NFIs and medical supplies mobilized and channeled into INTERSOS. In this regards, it will ensure to adhere and coordinate with other partners for identification of vulnerable communities and avoiding overlapping of responses and mitigating to improve the coordination system among partners on ground. \n\nThrough this project, a total of 40,000 (35,000 IDPs and 5,000 Host communities) floods affected individuals in Berdale will have access to a package of Emergency lifesaving integrated health with nutrition services in six months period. The BLS ambulances will provide referral services from IDPs to the fixed facility (MCH) to improve access to the integrated package for the vulnerable community prioritizing to rapidly refer the critical cases (priority will be given to under 5 children and pregnant women). It is estimated to provide BLS services to over 300 critical/emergency medical cases. The project will establish an efficient outreach and referral mechanism from community based to primary healthcare amp for primary to secondary health services through a network of CVs and through the BLS capacity of the Mobile Clinics vehicles for patient transportation.",

        "description": "Increased rainfall since the beginning of September in both Ethiopian highlands and within the catchments in Somalia has resulted in a sharp rise in the Shabelle and Juba rivers, leading to severe flooding in southern and central Somalia. According to UNHCR-Protection Return Monitoring Network (PRMN), the recent Shabelle river flooding displaced over 270,000 people, of whom 230,000 are in Beletweyne District. Farmland, infrastructure and roads have been destroyed, and livelihoods disrupted in some of the worst-hit areas. According to the FAO-led Somalia Water and Land Information Management (SWALIM), the rains are projected to continue in the coming weeks and it is expected to end in early December. DRC proposes to undertake a life-saving and sustainable assistance to Flood- Displaced people in Beletweyne through provision of emergency shelter kits (ESK), non-food items (NFIs). DRC will target 2050 households (12,300 people) with ESK and NFIs. The standard emergency NFI package will include plastic sheeting, blankets, sleeping mats, kitchen set, mosquito net, solar lamp and Jerry cans. Where possible, DRC will give the NFIs through cash transfers or vouchers so that beneficiaries can decide based on their needs. DRC will also assist with a standard ESK that contains: Local available stick for vertical post (Philippian Tree) Local available sticks for truss, door and windows (Philippian Tree) or White wood (8cm x 4cm size each) Local available sticks (Philippian Tree) for horizontal frames amp roofing or White wood (5cm x 2.5cm size each) Local available sticks (Philippian Tree) at the base of roof truss or White wood (10cm x 2.5cm size each) Nails No. 5 (5 inch) Nails No. 6 (6 inch) Drum door with frame Hinges for door Local plastic sheet (size: 4m x 7m) and outer wall clothing Buul layer. This provides the most basic shelter which can offer protection from extreme weather. The ESK helps the displaced household to put up by a 4m x 4m shelter structure within the first few days of displacement. DRC is aware that the needs are huge and the available funding cannot cover everyone. DRC is also aware that families of affected persons are normally the first responders and therefore, some families may be better positioned to survive such disaster due to their own social networks. Therefore DRC will develop a selection criteria based on AGD as well as vulnerability to ensure that assistance goes to the ones who deserve it most. Female-headed households, families with many children and the aged (65+ year-olds) will be given priority. DRC will also ensure that, persons living with disabilities (PLDs) or families with such persons are also targeted with assistance.  Families considered extremely vulnerable, will be assisted by DRC to put up their shelter through cash paid after erection. DRC determines that this cash shall be 60 USD and targets 540 hhs out of 2050 hhs. DRC will undertake a post-distribution monitoring (PDM) study four (4) weeks after distribution to measure the effectiveness of distribution and also the satisfaction of the beneficiaries on the items distributed. This will help inform future programming in shelter, NFIs and CCCM programming. Specific to CCCM, DRC shall engage in installation of solar lights and in settlement maintenance including clearance of any solid waste and access roads. DRC will also, jointly with the camp/settlement committees undertake mapping of available services and establish a referral system. Through that, DRC will establish information boards at strategic points like social centers like water points and markets for people to have easy access to information. DRC will support community governance structures through trainings to ensure that camp/settlement committees can manage their daily issues in a structured manner. At sub-national level, DRC will ensure coordination of CCCM meetings happen and deliberations are reported.",

        "description": "Flood triggered displacement is on the rise in Middle Shebelle, with new areas engulfed by floods water during the wet season every day. The displaced population is fleeing to high grounds leaving behind household assets completely submerged by water. Safe locations hosting displaced populations lack basic services including safe drinking water and sanitation services. The impact of this is a high incidence of water-borne diseases, growing protection concerns faced by women and girls, conflict activated by sharing of scarce resources and denying the right to access service subjected to people with disabilities, minority groups, and elderly people.\n\nIn this context, PAH will implement a WASH cluster-specific intervention aiming to 1) deliver life-saving WASH assistance to reduce acute need among the vulnerable settlement and communities 2) reduce risk of violence against women, children and vulnerable groups accessing WASH services 3) provide or restore sustainable access to safe water and adequate sanitation services in the targeted communities and institutions.\n\nFloods affected population is farming communities who rely on farming as the main source of livelihood to provide them with income and promote the local economy. PAH has conducted market analysis to assess the capacity of local markets to provide needed WASH items and determine the preference of the affected population. Most interviewed households preferred to be engaged in latrines construction. Based on market capacity and community preference, and building on its previous experience, PAH will construct emergency latrines through cash for work approach selecting skilled individuals from the target population and sourcing construction materials from local vendors pre-identified during the market analysis.\n\n\nTo reduce the negative impact of risky practices and minimize the risk of disease outbreak hygiene kits will be provided to displaced families. The content of the kits will meet cluster standards but will be topped-up with mosquito nets to protect children, pregnant women and elderly persons from malaria. Community-based hygiene promoters will be trained and WASH committees established to promote safe practices.\n\nPAH will implement these activities in the Jowhar district of the Middle Shebelle region. Approximately 13,890 people from 2315 HHs (households) will benefit from this intervention. PAH is one of the main WASH actors fully present in Middle Shebelle implementing emergency and resilience WASH activities in Jowhar and has easy access to crisis-affected locations. PAH is already responding to the flood crisis in Jowhar and is providing lifesaving WASH services including safe water and hygiene kits to 768 displaced people. To address malnutrition PAH is providing 2 months unrestricted cash transfer to 400 most vulnerable families who have lost crops and have malnourished household members. However, the increasing risks and absence of WASH services require immediate scale-up to avert further displacement and disease outbreak. Moreover, PAH will create synergies for improved coordination among WASH stakeholders in the area, including local authorities, clusters, and other NGOs.",

Heavy rains of more than 100mm are expected in Hiraan, Bay and Bakool regions which are already saturated following weeks of continued heavy rains. In South West State, an estimated 70,000 people have been affected and another 40,000 displaced by flash flooding across the region. Berdale town (60 km west of Baidoa) is worst affected. Three quarters of the town is submerged. Local authorities and humanitarian partners estimate that 30,000 people have been affected. The road to Berdale is impassable. Humanitarian partners are working with authorities to scale up the response in the affected areas INTERSOS is targeting to provide emergency WASH response to the floods affected population in Berdale as in line with the needs assessment report conducted by Inter-Agency to quickly identify the vast damages affected by the floods and the priority needs to immediately intervene the humanitarian situation. The report highlighted that around 360 unprotected shallow wells, which is 85% of the total shallow wells in Berdale, have been submerged by the floodwater. The IDPs and Host communities in the district depends on boreholes and shallow wells as their main source of water which is critical to survive after it has been submerged by the flash floods. The price of one drum of water (200ltr) is 20,000 Somali shilling which is approximately 1 USD therefore, 95% of the Berdale residents have no access to safe water supply due to the pool stagnant water and submerged of all other shallow wells by the floods.\n\nINTERSOS is the focal point for Berdale flood response in collaboration with all partners and cluster leads for distribution of hygiene kits, NFIs and medical supplies mobilized and channeled into INTERSOS. In this regards, INTERSOS will ensure to adhere and coordinate with other partners for identification of vulnerable communities and avoiding overlapping of responses and mitigating to improve the coordination system among partners on ground. \n  \n\nThe   objective of the response is to provide lifesaving emergency WASH assistance to 6500 HH from the  most vulnerable population affected by the floods in Berdale district to improve the access of clean and safe water through provision of water tracking, hygiene promotion and shallow wells rehabilitations. The proposed response aims to increase the access of clean safe water to the community and decreases the acute watery diarrhea/cholera outbreaks and waterborne diseases, which is one of the priorities in the HRP strategy of INTERSOS and in line with the SHF reserve allocation of 2019 for the flood response. The project will enable INTERSOS to convert proposed immediate needs outlined by the Inter-agency report into immediate interventions to respond the floods affected communities in Berdale.  \n\nINTERSOS will address the sanitation and hygiene practices among the target beneficiaries through hygiene promotion, distribution of hygiene kits and provision of water purified tablets and water treatment of all water sources through training of water management committees, community volunteers and hygiene promoters with water treatment and chlorination. The project also targets to improve the knowledge, attitude and practices of the community for sanitation and hygiene practices at community and household level to ensure access in water quality and enhancing the level of understanding to the community in public ownership for regular monitoring and supervision. \nThroughout this proposed lifesaving assistance, INTERSOS will provide WASH packages and services to approximately 25,000 beneficiaries (host community and IDPs) of which 8,937 are women and 7,313 men. 4,812 out of the targeted proposed beneficiaries are girls and 3,938 will be boys  . \n\n30 community volunteers will be trained",

Also this project is working to rehabilitate WASH facilities damaged by the floods including repair, disinfection and protection against further flooding. It will contribute to the reduction of emergency WASH gaps reported and works to improve the hygiene practices of the affected communities through kit distribution and awareness campaigns. \nThe project is for 6 months targeting a total beneficiary of 30,000 individuals living in Baldweyn. This reserve allocation will enable QC to scale up flood responses in Beledweyn and reach more beneficiaries in the coming months. \n1.\tThis Project will work to provide emergency water trucking through voucher to flood affected communities in Beledweyn. Currently, potential high-risk areas for the water trucking activities are areas where people are displaced to. A total of 2,500 households equivalent to 15,000 people will be supported  with water voucher for 3 months and each person will be provided 15 l/p/d (acceptable WASH cluster standards in Somalia), with total of 2,520 trucks.\nQC will also provide water to health/nutrition facilities and schools within the target communities. QC will competitively contract water vendors to supply households with agreed quantities over the specified period. Households provided with vouchers will access their allocation of water at the water distribution point on a daily basis. The community water monitors will register the collection of the water in a register book with the household representative and signing or thumb print as a record. All the supplied water will be chlorinated. In addition, a list of recommended boreholes will be mapped out for water trucking. This list will also be shared with suppliers before contracting them.\n2.\tIn addition to the access for drinking water, the proposed project will ensure to improve hygiene practices among the flood-affected people through hygiene kit distribution from WASH supply hub and hygiene promotion awareness. 60 community hygiene promotes will be trained and supported to conduct hygiene awareness and best hygiene practices. This will reduce the risk of AWD/cholera outbreak and improves the sanitation of the targeted Households.\n3.\tAs part of community sanitation improvement and protection against water borne diseases, the proposed project will replace and construct 220 flood resistant latrines through owner driven approach in which QC providers construction materials through voucher system in addition to the labor incentives as cash transfer. Also rehabilitation of 40 institutional latrines in damaged health facilities, schools and public institutions. In addition to this, project will work to repair and disinfect 30 damaged water sources (Shallow wells) and protect them against further flooding. \n\nWith the funds from SHF, QC will work closely with state level and local level authorities, local elders, community members and floods affected population to undertake and determine the project beneficiaries. During the beneficiary identification process QC will consider child-headed households, households headed by disabled persons or elderly persons without support Households with children under 5 poor female-headed households poor households with children admitted in nutrition programs, poor pregnant and lactating women. Public verification will be made which will surely encourage accountability, transparency and fair selection. The project will extend feedback and compliant mechanism already in place where beneficiaries can be able to present their concerns for assistance. A monitoring and evaluation system will also be extended to this project to ensure that project progresses are in line with the objective and intended WASH outcomes.",

The WASH intervention will improve the health and reduce the risk of disease outbreaks in flood-affected communities through increased access to safe water, use of latrines, hygiene promotion and increased adoption of safe hygiene practices. Cash programming, in the form of conditional transfers, vouchers, and cash for work (CfW), will form a core pillar of the proposed intervention. Specifically, the project will provide emergency and flood-resistant sanitation services, rehabilitate water systems, including repair, disinfection, and reinforcement against further flooding, and promote improved hygiene practices. Relief International (RI) will prioritize the rehabilitation and reinforcement of damaged water and sanitation infrastructure to withstand future floods. In the rehabilitation of latrines at household, communal and institutional levels, RI will adopt flood-resistant design and construction methods. Specifically, RI will train masons on flood- resistant latrine construction techniques, procure construction materials, and incentivize the rehabilitation of targeted latrines through vouchers. RI will assess the damage and strategically rehabilitate, reinforce for flood resistance, and disinfect strategic water points. Newly flood-displaced people will have increased access to safe water from RI contracted water trucking companies. To minimize overlap, RI will continue to liaise with Qatar Charity and Save the Children on water trucking targeting. Through the regional WASH cluster and the government-led floods taskforce, RI will coordinate with government, UN agencies, and NGO partners on the response. RI will solicit feedback from community members on their needs and other support they may be receiving from other sources to appropriately target the proposed interventions and minimize overlap and duplication. Through a CfW scheme, able-bodied community members will establish a disposal site to dispose appropriately of debris that has accumulated due to floods. With in-kind hygiene kits distributed to flood-affected households and targeted dissemination of hygiene promotion messages, RI will promote improved hygiene. RI will leverage its health and nutrition data to target hotspots for acute diarrheal disease. This case tracing approach will support the proactive targeting of people in need of hygiene promotion, hygiene kits, safe water, and latrines. Trained hygiene promoters will complement case tracing with routine interaction with community members and door-to-door household hygiene awareness campaigns. RI will target newly flood-displaced people in settlements and after they return. RI will assess the situation at the time of implementation to ensure that newly flood-displaced are primarily targeted. These interventions will improve wellbeing, prevent morbidity, and restore dignity for flood-affected communities in Beletweyne.",

        "description": "The project will contribute to 3 core strategic objectives for the Somalia HRP 2019. SHF Reserve Allocation and Life-saving response in current and potential hot spots addressing the immediate impact of floods and. Urgent life-saving assistance for communities affected by the floods Address the secondary impacts of flood in the affected areas while also ensuring integration of protection elements and sustainable solutions in all flood response activities. This project will address the dire WASH humanitarian needs for flood-affected communities in Mahaday town of Jowhar district of the Middle Shabelle region through access to safe water, emergency hygiene, and sanitation. The project will address WASH gaps and reduce risks of incidents of AWD/cholera outbreaks, morbidity and mortality among emergency flood-affected communities and vulnerable populations. The project will target 15205 (6234 women, 3802 men, 3101 girls, 2068 boys) including disadvantaged families and elderly persons, Disabilities, children, and women in emergencies to be provided adequate safe water, sanitation facilities, and hygiene promotion services. WASH services of good hygiene and sanitation practices will be promoted in the affected communities by providing adequate WASH facilities such as construction of 435 emergency latrines with handwashing facilities, with lockable doors and with handwashing facilities only in areas where latrine rehabilitation is not possible or where there is a complete gap of sanitation facilities especially in IDP/host communities, provision of WASH packages to vulnerable affected communities, provision of emergency  safe drinking water through CVA (target 700 families with duration of 2 months) and constructing 10 shallow wells with hand pump and rehabilitation of 6 unfunctional shallow wells in Mahaday by focusing on those severely affected by floods. The shallow wells are rehabilitated and upgraded to have protection, including repair, disinfection and protection against further flooding with hand pumps installed. SCC will train and recruit 20 (8male, 12 female) Community Hygiene Promoters in Mahaday. The training will be 5-days to promote change the behavior of the beneficiaries through PHAST amp CHAST training components, in close collaboration with the local authorities, community leaders and the ministry of water and energy and ministry of health and social services of Hirshabelle state of Somalia. This project will establish and train 32 (16 Male, 16 Female) water committees that will be selected 2 persons from each water source. A total of 3000 (1350 male, 1650 female) will be distributed to hygiene kits (soap, water treatment tablets, and 20L jerrycans.) A total of 87 flood-damaged latrines will be rehabilitated through CFW modality through selected skilled persons among the flood-affected communities.  a total of 700 families will receive safe drinking water to flood-affected communities through Cash Voucher Assistance (CVA) while water points will be rehabilitated to recover the damaged essential WASH infrastructures and as well as improve the livelihoods of flood-affected communities through CFW modality. The CFW will be used to strengthen WASH market-based programming and this fully in line with Somalia WASH cluster strategy to promote the integration of MBP for all WASH activities. This project will also target 201 women and adolescents girls who affected recent floods providing soap, petticoat, pants, and sanitary pads.",

        "title": "Sustainable Access to clean Water,Hygiene and Sanitation to droughts affected communities in Sanaag and Sool region",
        "description": "Sanaag and Sool regions have been facing both acute and chronic water shortages for many years. The prolonged droughts experienced in 2016/2017 have seriously affected the local communities and the water facilities too. The traditional water facilities, such as shallow wells, water pans, dams frequently dry out and there are very few boreholes-which frequently breakdown due to high demand and overuse. Badhan for instance, has a high population (89,435 people) in Eastern Sanaag, and is an old town with no permanent water sources. During the dry period, people trek more than 100km to the nearest water points, while the water prices unreasonably increase to more than 300% (Adeso internal reports). Qawlo under Taleex has similar water needs as Badhan, with an estimated population of 73,529 (UNPFA 2014 data). These 2 locations (Badhan and Qawlo) are highly populated with large rural and [pastoral population and they frequently face water shortages.  \nAdeso propose to drill and equip strategic boreholes in these 2 main centers with adequate water distribution system. The project will be implemented together with the private sector, community and the government to ensure contributions from all stakeholders, the ownership and foreseeable sustainability. Our strategy is to encourage a participatory process with the key stakeholders being involved, develop local ownership and strengthen governance structure for such response. Adeso will enhance this strategy to enable value for money and high impact for this project.  The community and the private sector will contribute 20% of the total cost of Badhan borehole (that is equivalent to $40,000).\nThe drilling and equipping will be done through a competent local contractor, thoroughly vetted by the community, the government and Adeso technical team. Adeso will hire a water engineer, fully dedicated for this project and ensure the expected standards are met. The same contractor will do the hydro-geological survey, identify the best aquifer, present report for deliberation before moving to the actual drilling.  Adeso has strong experience in Somalia and combining hydro-geological survey and drilling into one contract will ensure smooth operation and that the contractor meets the expectation as per the contract.  Adeso will carry out, through its WASH team, an environmental and social impact analysis that may come as a result of the new borehole and apply the necessary mitigation measures in good time.  The proposed boreholes will have several distribution systems, including different water points for the livestock to avoid water contamination. \nThe project will also construct latrines for the poor households, hygiene and sanitation awareness as well as strengthening the water governance structures. The ministries of water, both from Somaliland side for Talex / Qawlo site and Puntland side for Badhan will be involved to ensure the government support and also the response meet the government vision of providing adequate water to the people. \nA water ground breaking analysis will be done to determine the chemical, mineral and the biological analysis of the water.  This will be done as soon as the ground water is hit before any further work is done. The region has a history of salinity and great care needs to be taken with this, so if one aquifer fails or becomes saline, then the contractor moves to another site until the best water quality is achieved. \nAdeso is currently implementing an OFDA funded WASH project in these regions, that has mainly rehabilitation of the rural water facilities-such as shallow wells, boreholes, water pans with hygiene and sanitation components. A climate change adaption project is also being implemented in building community resilience to shocks / adaptation. Adeso recently concluded a 5 year EU Natural resource management program. These interventions provide strong complementarity to the proposed response that will result in high impact.",

        "description": "The humanitarian situation in Northern Somalia in 2018 remains fragile due to residual impact of drought, Cyclone Sagar, conflict and ongoing displacement. While the risk of famine has reduced, humanitarian needs remain high, with extreme water and pasture shortages reported in rainfall deficit areas of Bari, Nugaal, Sool and Sanaag regions. Water scarcity in Sool and Sanaag regions has reached a precarious level, affecting the health of the most vulnerable people and causing occasional resource-based clan conflicts. With only a third of the population having access to improved sanitation, poor hygiene practices (including frequent open defecation) are prevalent, contributing to incidences of water-borne diseases. Consequently, there is an urgent need to improve WASH service delivery at district level. \n\nIn this context, ACTED will implement a WASH cluster-specific intervention aiming to 1) Provide reliable and sustained access to sufficient safe water, based on identified strategic water points 2) Establish an appropriate system for the management and maintenance of facilities, with different groups contributing equitably and 3) Enhance community sanitation and hygiene awareness. \n\nACTED will implement these activities in Taleex district of Sool region, and Erigavo and Dararweyne districts of Sanaag region, targeting a highly vulnerable and largely undeserved area. Approximately 15,000 people (2,500 households) will benefit from this intervention, in addition to creating synergies for improved coordination among WASH stakeholders in the area, including local authorities, clusters and other NGOs. These numbers might vary due to external factors such as the drought, which might attract more IDPs, or escalation of conflict, which may cause communities to flee to other areas.",

        "description": "Somalia is in a fragile state, drought prone and faces food insecurity, which is exacerbated by poor health care, lack of access to safe drinking water and safe sanitation facilities.\nAccess to maternal health services and antenatal care coverage remain low. Only about 26 per cent of Somalis have antenatal care coverage, and the number of necessary emergency care facilities for obstetrics is 0.8 per 500,00 people.  This means the number of facilities is 4.2 facilities short of the international standard of five facilities per 500,000 people.\nPregnancy or childbirth-related complications such as hemorrhage, obstructed labour, infection, high blood pressures and unsafe abortion are the main contributors to maternal morbidity and mortality in Somalia.\nThe health needs of the IDPs and the vulnerable urban poor of the host community in Qardho is very acute given the overstretched nature of limited resources due to the influx of IDPs, returnees and refugees. \nIn this project, Qatar Red Crescent Society will improve the access and utilization of Emergency PHC services for women and children living in the most crisis affected populations in Qardho IDP settlements and the vulnerable urban poor in Qardho. One static facility and 2 mobile outreach teams will be set up in Qardho and strengthened through provision of medical supplies and the improvement staff capacity. Remote villages will be reached through mobile clinics community mobilizers and CHWs will be recruited and trained. Among the activities that QATAR RED CRESCENT SOCIETY will provide include routine and campaign immunization to 11715 under 5 children (5753 boys 5962 girls) and 6032 Women of childbearing age (WCBA) Provision of antenatal and post-natal care to pregnant and lactating mothers (Target =3248 ). Treatment and control of communicable diseases targeting 22155 which includes: 5753 boys, 5962 girls, 3248 PLW, 6032 WCBA and 1160 men Strengthen referral system between Primary Healthcare facilities, the community (remote villages) and the regional hospital (Qardho) Establishment of two mobile clinics Conduct Disease Surveillance and Response plan Training of 21 health workers (14 female and 7 Male) on clinical management of childhood illness, Basic Emergency Obstetric and Newborn Care and disease surveillance and response. The training will be conducted once and 10 community health workers (5 females and 5 male) will be trained on intergated community case management on communicable disease such as pneumonia, diarrhea, and malaria.",

Education specific activities will include the provision of education supplies, emergency take-away food rations for students to meet their food and energy needs and emergency teacher incentives to motivate teachers to stay in the schools. Specific WASH activities will include increasing schools\u2019 water storage capacity through the provision of PVC storage tanks, the construction and rehabilitation of latrines, and improving hygiene practices among children through engagement with school hygiene promoters. As hygiene promoters will interact closely with students during hygiene promotion sessions and recreational activities, CISP will train this cadre on hygiene promotion, psycho-social support (PSS), and child protection and safeguarding. Specific Protection activities will include the mapping and sharing of existing child protection service providers and their respective services to school administrators and communities, strengthening child protection systems in schools, including the recruitment and training of child protection focal persons at each school, and awareness raising and training of community education committees (CEC) on child protection. CISP will also continue to engage with Ministry of Education Culture and Higher Education (MoECHE) and train cluster partners and MoE staffs on safe schools contingency planning, DRR and emergency response. CISP will provide training to CECs on their roles and responsibilities, food and water management, disaster risk reduction (DRR), civic skills, proposal development, and child protection in the respective schools. To ensure water availability in targeted schools, CISP will provide cash grants to CECs. In return, CECs will contribute in-kind or cash to procure safe water and manage its distribution to students. Further, the CECs will be trained on DRR to build their capacity and improve school preparedness against armed attack and other natural disasters. Disability and gender-friendly latrines in the targeted schools will be rehabilitated or, where necessary, constructed to minimize disruptions in learning for girls and boys. CISP will coordinate enrollment drives through MoE and with CECs and religious leaders to encourage school enrollment with an emphasis on children affected by displacement. CISP education department will utilize the existing synergies with CISP protection department to assess the existing child protection mechanisms at the start of the project, and, as determined from the assessment results, targeted schools will develop appropriate action plans to address areas of concern. To measure the effectiveness of the child protections systems implemented and capture lessons learned, CISP will conduct an end line assessment. Through the CISP protection department engagement with CEC\u2019s and the regional Gender Focal Points (GFP\u2019s) of MoE, CISP will leverage the agency's apparatus and community assets to raise awareness among children on child protection and the established mechanisms which will serve to strengthen child protection in schools.",

        "description": "With the complex and unpredictable humanitarian situation in Somalia and with the reduced risk of famine in the year 2019, the overall risk still lingers. Two long decades of armed conflicts, clan clashes and drought have resulted in millions of Somalis becoming in dire need of basic life savings assistance. Forced to flee their homes to survive, today there remains a staggering 2.6 million internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Somalia. Based on total numbers, Somalia represents the fourth largest IDP crisis in the world. \n\nCurrently, an estimated 2.6 million people across Somalia remain internally displaced and highly impoverished. Deyr assessment results indicate that the 11 major Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) settlements are in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or Stressed (IPC Phase 2) in the presence of humanitarian assistance. In most urban areas, food security outcomes are Stressed (IPC Phase 2) or Minimal (IPC Phase 1). However, households in urban areas in Burao (Toghdeer) region are facing food consumption gaps and are classified as Crisis (IPC Phase 3), driven by high cost of living and limited income-earning opportunities. This notwithstanding, the sustained and large scale humanitarian coordination is preventing more severe outcomes in many regions across Somalia. \nIn this context ACTED will: Establish, reinforce and strengthen governance, management and coordination mechanisms at appropriate levels Increase site safety through site maintenance and improvement works and Capacity Build Camp Governance, CCCM stakeholders and local authorities working towards self-management. ACTED will implement this intervention in 31 sites across Burao and Buhodle (16 sites in Burao and 15 sites in Buhodle). \n\nFEWS NET Post Deyr technical release projects that in Togdheer region of Somaliland that 181,000 people will be stressed IPC phase 2, 91,000 in crisis IPC phase 3 and 13,000 in emergency IPC phase 4 by June, 2020 if humanitarian assistance is not extended to the region. \n\nCamp coordination and camp management is a relatively new concept within the region and it is of utmost importance that key stakeholders i.e. government officials and humanitarian actors, be sensitized on this concept. It is necessary to increase awareness on this technical concept and equip stakeholders with the relevant capacity to implement such interventions.",

Rapid service mapping of actors will also be conducted to understand who is doing what and where to inform intervention areas and avoid duplication. NoFYL field teams shall actively participate in coordination mechanisms in Kaxda and Deynille to ensure other actors are updated on NoFYL plans in targeted districts to avoid overlap. This project will fill existing gaps in ESNFI, CCCM, Protection, and WASH support and complement activities undertaken under other ongoing projects. NoFYL will carry out post-distribution monitoring utilizing a tailored PDM tool in all targeted locations within 1 month of each assistance intervention sampling 20-30% of beneficiaries in each location. \n \nNoFYL, PAH and HINNA will implement these activities in 15 IDP sites in Deynille and Kaxda, targeting the most underserved area home to most newly displaced drought IDPs in the same sites to enhance the delivery of protection services as a complement to the other activities. 4,064 households, approximately 24,384 people (3,283 male, 4,886 female, 6,505 boys and 9,710 girls) will benefit from this intervention, as well as the whole community working in these 41 IDP sites including local authorities, clusters, and other organizations. The multi-sectoral approach will be useful to create synergies enabling the concentration of services and expertise within the same location and the same population leading to achieving a greater impact.\n \nThe three partners (NoFYL, PAH and HINNA) will build on each other strengths and better complement each other to ensure community acceptance and success in implementation. The synergy between the 3 sectoral partners will ensure sound management of the program, greater impact, efficiency, and more cost-effective operations. The project target sites includes the following\n\nDeynille - Yaagle camp, Igadabagey, Bacaad, Alle suge, Shidane k7, walaalaha, Wanaagsan, Ramaas, Taad, Iskaashi IDP camps\nKaxda - Owbaale 1, Jimale 1, Bananey, Waraanle, Rabisuge, and Mudan IDP camps.",

        "description": "In 2019, COVID-19 emerged, and the WHO has declared its outbreak as a global pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic is a global health crisis that has resulted in a great disruption to education worldwide. Education has been hit particularly hard by the COVID-19 pandemic with 1.53 billion learners out of school and 184 country-wide school closures, impacting 87.6% of the world\u2019s total enrolled learners. Drop-out rates across the globe are likely to rise as a result of this massive disruption to education access. Thus, the Somali Government took precautionary measures as stopping international flights, closing learning institutions, and banning large public gathers. As the Government continues to monitor the situation, CISP plans to mitigate and minimize the impact of school closure and interrupted student learning, particularly for the most vulnerable. As there is a lack of clarity on how the COVID-19 situation will evolve globally and locally in Somalia, CISP will forecast long-term contingency measures ensuring that the impact of COVID-19 on students will be addressed as schools remain closed. In Somalia, it has affected learning and forced the closure of learning institutions including schools and universities since March 18th, 2020. In responding to this outbreak, CISP adapts the Ministry of Education, Culture, and Higher Education (MoECHE) strategy on COVID-19 preparedness and response. \nThe proposed 9-month intervention will target 12 schools with an enrolment of 3462 learners with the provision of food, TLM, and Dignity kit while 19,890 adults and children of school-going age children will be targeted with radio PSA and health messages to provide mitigation measures on the impact of COVID-19 on top of other existing challenges such as conflict, drought and desert locust for learners both school holidays and when schools reopen. The project will improve access to critical WASH inputs, emergency food for students to meet their food and energy needs, payment of emergency teacher incentives to motivate teachers to stay in the schools, provision of teaching and learning materials (TLM). Specific WASH activities will include the distribution of handwashing soaps, liquid detergents, rehabilitation of latrines, provision of storage water tanks, water trucking for schools with no constant water supply, and improving hygiene practices among children through engagement with school hygiene promoters. Following the Federal guideline on social distancing CISP will work with the ministry of health and MoECHE to explore the possibility of having smaller groups of teacher and CEC\u2019s to train so as to maintain 1.5-meter distance in order to implement a lifesaving training of hygiene and Sanitation on preparedness, mitigation and response to COVID-19 pandemic and identification of COVID-19 symptoms to prevent the spread of COVID-19 among the school community. CISP proposes this project to improve access to quality education and making schools child-friendly for COVID-19, drought and conflict-affected communities, and host community children Galgaduud region of Galmudug State of Somalia. The project directly addresses the educational needs of both the displaced and host community children. This project will create a protective environment for children through the improvement of hygiene/sanitation in schools thereby making schools learner-friendly and also the provision of quality education through providing learning resources, general community sensitization through radio PSA will be aired through Galmudug radio station on the COVID-19 pandemic awareness and prevention.",

        "description": "Despite a favorable Deyr (October- December) rainy season, the lingering effects of the drought in 2018/2019, and flooding an estimated 1.3 million people in Somalia will be in Crisis (IPC Phase3) through mid-2020 without sustained humanitarian assistance. Currently, 4 million people are experiencing acute food insecurity, out of whom 2.9 million are Stressed (IPC Phase 2) and 1.1 million are facing Crisis or worse. Among the most vulnerable are 2.6 million internally displaced persons (IDPs) who remain highly impoverished. According to IOM, October 2019 report, Baidoa, the capital of Bay region, hosts one of the largest IDP populations in Somalia. According to figures compiled by the international community, as of September 2019, Baidoa had 359,994 internally displaced persons, consisting of 51,322 households on 435 sites.\n\nTherefore, looking into this precarious situation, the proposed project is designed to respond to the immediate lifesaving and life sustaining basic needs of poor and vulnerable displacement affected communities in Bay region. Project proposes three rounds of Multipurpose cash transfers to the most vulnerable displacement affected communities. Moreover, project will also provide cereal crops and vegetable seeds to displacement affected communities living in the off camp area. At the same time this we understand that as a result of locust infestation, beneficiaries pastoral and agro-pastoral communities are forced to migrate to other areas, therefore under this program NRC will be providing Fodder vouchers to the migrating communities. Support in the form of fodder vouchers will help communities to purchase fodder for their livestock during the time of migration. This cash injection will help benefiting households in accessing food and other unmet needs on immediate basis from the accessible markets. The monthly cash transfer amount will be as per the cash and market working group recommended transfer rate which will help beneficiaries to meet 80% of the full minimum expenditure basket. As a result of cash injection, affected households will have improved access to the diversified food and will positively contribute to the nutritional outcomes. \n\nProposed project is in line with the Food Security cluster strategic response objectives SO1: Improve households\u2019 immediate access to food through provision of conditional and unconditional cash assistance depending on the severity of food insecurity phases, vulnerability and seasonality of the livelihoods.\n\nAs soon as beneficiaries identification and  registration will be completed, NRC will be conducting a Baseline survey in order to have baseline values. After baseline, registered beneficiaries will be released monthly multipurpose cash transfer in line to the cash and market recommended transfer rates using electronic services of Harmuud. NRC team will be collecting post distribution monitoring (PDM) data two weeks after release of each round of cash transfer. As a standard practice, PDM captures some of the key information around timeliness of support, progress against critical indicators including \u2018Food consumption score (FCS) and Household dietary diversity score\u2019. PDM also monitors expenditure patterns of the provided support and determines measures for corrective actions if there are deviations from objective.",

        "description": "The overall objective of the proposed project is that the food security situation of 865 vulnerable households (5160 individuals) in mostly rural communities in Zeylac district of Somaliland is stabilized and communities are more resilient towards adverse conditions.\n\nTo achieve the overall objective, the project offers: a) unconditional and b) conditional cash transfers for improved access to food. The project directly targets an estimated 5160 individuals ( mostly rural communities) particularly women, children and the elderly and other vulnerable persons in Casha Cado, Togoshi, Lawya cado, Sheikh Awaare and Zeyla villages. The project duration is 8 months to allow families to recover from adverse weather conditions and the potential desert locusts\u2019 threat. \n\nSpecifically, 565 households (HH) will receive Unconditional Cash Transfers (UCT) while 300 households will receive Conditional Cash Transfers. The cash transfers empower people with choice to address their essential and individual food needs, while also helping to boost local markets. Another reason for Candlelight to apply cash transfer are the reduced facilitation costs, as mobile transfers do require less administrative costs. The cash values to be transferred on a monthly basis are provided by the Cash Working Group (CWG) Somalia based on minimum expenditure basket (MEB) as per region across Somalia. The latest food cash transfer values for families in Awdal are USD 90 (October - December 2019)\n\nThe target group for the UCT will mainly be the rural and most vulnerable families facing high levels of food insecurity among other vulnerabilities. The timeframe for UCT to be disbursed will be 4 months to stabilize food security levels in the lean and Ramadhan seasons. The major activities for UCT will start with sharing selection criteria in a transparent manner with village leaders and communities. \n\nA local telephone company (Telesom) with extensive experience of conducting cash transfer to beneficiaries in remote areas will be commissioned to conduct monthly cash transfers to beneficiaries mobile phones. The beneficiaries who may not know how to use the services will be trained on how to use it. \n\nFor conditional cash transfers relating to Cash for Work (CfW) activities, the project will follow a similar selection and disbursement cycle. As part of CfW, the project will, village cleaning campaigns and rehabilitation/ replanting of mangrove forests especially in Toqoshi and Zeyla villages to provide for sustainable communal livelihood assets that enhance collective resilience. The individual sites for CfW activities will be identified together with the communities. The CfW beneficiary selection criterion will be their physical capacity in conjunction with the vulnerability of their families, such as families with more than three children, or families who lost major parts of their livestock and livelihoods. The families with men eligible for CfW might not be as vulnerable as the families receiving the UCT, however they have a risk of sliding into crisis mode. Beneficiaries shall be paid at a rate of approximately 7 USD each based on a standard piece of work but each beneficiary working for atleast 13 days in a month. Each 50 Cash for Work beneficiaries will be supervised by 1 foreman who will be paid a slightly high rate of approximately 10 USD each working day.",

The 7-month project will be implemented in 10 villages in Abudwak. The project has two outputs. Output one will contribute to 400 food-insecure households (2400 people \u2013 1224 Male and 1176 Female) having immediate access to food through unconditional Cash transfer. Of these,  200 HH are IDPs located in Abudwaq town. \nOutput 2 targets 1,632 HH (9794 people) in the protection and restoration of their livelihoods for increased food and income sources. Of these, 900 HH will benefit from animal treatment meant to restore approximately 27,000 livestock to better health. This intervention will improve the livestock economic value as well as the value of meat and milk for household consumption. 6,000 additional and emaciated livestock will receive animal feed concentrate for a month to help them recover their health and increase production. The project will install a solar-powered pumping system to pump water from the Dalsan village borehole to the elevated village water tank which will then use gravity to distribute to the village water kiosk and livestock watering troughs that were constructed by NAPAD with funding from German-FFO. Over 430 HH in Dalsan will benefit from climate and economic friendly source of water for their livestock estimated to be 12,960. To increase household access to nutritious food 100 women will be supported to diversify into small scale kitchen gardening of vegetables and fruits. These women will be capacity built on kitchen gardening, supported with seeds and farming tools and mentored by NAPAD agronomist in establishing the kitchen gardens in their homesteads. The farms will be designed to ensure that the least amount of water is utilized in agricultural production. Women from the Dalsan village will especially benefit from the proposed solar water pumping system that will provide water to irrigate the kitchen gardens. Inagabille households and livestock will get their water from NAPAD constructed, G-FFO funded elevated 60,000 litres tank and animal troughs. These women will be capacity built on kitchen gardening, supported with seeds and farming tools and mentored by NAPAD agronomist in establishing the kitchen gardens in their homesteads.

Moreover, this project will also focus on building the capacities of the IDP leadership and local actors to gradually take over the camp management responsibilities. \n\nNoFYL will conduct the basic care and maintenance of the camps in Daynille District and spontaneous settlements in the Afgooye District the upcoming care and maintenance phase presents a different range of challenges, requiring strong humanitarian leadership and very close engagement with the population to promote community ownership and empowerment, as well as the gradual transfer of responsibility for the care of the site infrastructure. NoFYL will continue to work regularly with IDP camp leadership and committees to strengthen collaboration and their participation in decision-making processes, while also striving to improve diversity in representation and gender balance in the governance structure. As NoFYL anticipates, new arrivals will continue to seek shelter within the sites and spontaneous settlements throughout the project period, NoFYL's Camp Management team will support this population with reception and conduct site verification monthly. The quarterly Site Verification exercise in Afgoye district will be conducted to provide multi-sector information on access and availability to basic services in the floods affected sites to ascertain gaps in service provision and monitor services being provided, the verification will be conducted by NoFYL's multi-functional mobile teams, this will help to produce detailed information on the population of each site, its perimeter, access and services available in sites. NoFYL will use this data and contribute to its dissemination in order to inform humanitarian response at each level.\n\nThis overarching objective will be achieved by enhancing the overall protective environment for flood-affected population, increasing access to basic services linked to different sectors, reducing the risk, and availing specialized support assistance to beneficiaries to help them address other interconnected protection concerns. The action is also conceptualized to consolidate the ongoing humanitarian response to the flood situation in the targeted locations. Through this grant, NoFYL will reach 1,550 HHs in 8 umbrella Camps (considering minimum 180 HHs per settlement) with a total target beneficiary of 12,400 in Daynille and  Afgooye districts with necessary services through a coordination mechanism set in place with relevant stakeholders and other partners.\n\nThis project will also be linked to this ongoing protection/HLP activities through monitoring, documentation, and reporting of threats to evictions by assessing potential eviction sites, preventing and responding to eviction. Capacity development targeting settlement managers, CMCs, and local authorities on Housing, Land, and proper protection monitoring through ensuring collection of information based on the methodology of the Somalia Protection Monitoring System (SPMS).",

Partners will continue to forge synergies with organizations, civil society and local authorities operating within targeted IDP sites to greatly strengthen, reinforce and harmonize COVID-19 risk communication and hardware activities that are occurring within Deynile and Hodan IDP sites.\n\nAVORD: Through joint collaboration, AVORD will provide site-level RCCE encapsulating the cluster\u2019s RCCE Plan and adapting efforts based on findings from the CCCM Cluster\u2019s RCCE Feedback Assessment. Implementation of a site-level complaints feedback mechanism (CFM) will occur with the system adhering to the cluster\u2019s standards and following guidelines put forth by the Community Engagement Working Group.\n\nSCC (separate proposal): Through joint collaboration, WASH partners will organize hygiene promotion activities supported by CCCM partner via mobilizing community members and certain targeted members of the IDP site. When feasible, WASH partners will provide of emergency WASH services to IDP sites (water supply, hygiene promotion-installation, of handwashing stations and distribution of soap for hand washing to sites that do not have access these services.\n\nRadio Ergo (contracted): Producing specialized COVID-19 response and prevention information detailing health referral pathways, COVID-19 knowledge, and incorporating radio shows with community members such as religious leaders and Camp Management Committee (CMC) members.",

        "description": "This project is designed to respond to education, WASH and protection needs of children affected by floods in seven rural villages of Jowhar District of Middle Shabelle in Hirshabelle State of Somali for six months. The villages have either been affected by floods due to River Shabelle breaking its banks and flooding the settlements and farmlands in the riverine areas or flash floods sweeping the villages as a result of above-normal heavy Hagaa rains experienced in the region. The Guu rains expected between October and December are likely to result further deterioration of the situation.\nEducation facilities in the targeted villages are closed since most of them were affected either flood from river bank breakage that saw them completely inundated or marooned by water. \nThe villages are generally food insecure as the population is faced with acute unemployment, the prohibitive cost of living, and lack of skill sets by majority of the dwellers to eke meaningful living. The situation is further exacerbated by cyclic droughts and flash floods that are making agro-pastoralism lifestyle untenable and thus many are dropping out to join the ever-increasing population of vulnerable persons in the riverine regions. The worst affected are children and women who often bear the brunt of neglect and abandonment during these hard times. This often makes them susceptible to abuses and exploitations such as Gender-Based Violence, sexual exploitation, early marriages, child labor and recruitment to armed groups. \nThe project intends to use school attendance as an important preventive factor for child protection, particularly the girl-child. The project will employ such interventions as, training of teachers on basic child protection skills, provision of child-friendly environment through improvement and repair of damaged temporary/ permanent classrooms. Aid Vision will establish and strengthen the capacity of CtC clubs to provide peer interaction forums to learners, provision of teaching and learning materials-including recreational materials, capacity building of CBCPCs to raise awareness on risks of child abuse and enhance children\u2019s access and retention at schools. The CBCPCs will contribute to service mapping, identification of referral pathways and disseminate the information about available child protection service for children in the community. CP Focal Points, trained on PSS/PFA, will facilitate structured gender sensitive recreational and PSS activities at the schools for both boys and girls throughout the project live and conduct child safety walk and audit/ /risk mapping exercises with the guidance of project CP supervisor.\nTo address urgent WASH needs at the schools and ensure continuous learning for 2000 learners, Aid Vision will supply water to 7 schools for 6 months which will be delivered by trucks. Each school will have water storage tank with taps placed at strategic location for easy access. 23 twin gender-sensitive latrines will be constructed at schools that lack sanitation facilities. All latrines will have sufficient water, hand washing facilities and lockable doors for meaningful access. Girls and boys will attend CP awareness sessions to be organized for all schools. This is aimed at ensuring they have preventive skills on violence against children. Girls latrines usage will be monitored and corrective actions taken to address safety concerns. Regular hygiene promotion campaigns focusing on handwashing and safe water handling will be conducted at schools for 14 days to prevent the risk of AWD/Cholera outbreak. Hygiene promotion sessions will follow where schools\u2019 health clubs will disseminate messages on good hygiene practices at schools. To ensure schools have sustained access to water 2 shallow wells damaged by floods will be rehabilitated and protected with hand-pumps. 9 manually operated hand-free hand washing stations will be installed and soap for hand washing provided to reduce risk/transmission of COVID-19.",

        "description": "The floods have been triggered by heavy, above-average rainfall locally and in upstream areas in the Ethiopian highlands and have affected Gedo, Hiraan, Middle Juba, and Middle and Lower Shabelle regions. The situation has been exacerbated by weak river embankments and open riverbanks. The worst affected districts are Balcad, Jowhar, and Mahaday in Middle Shabelle (Hirshabelle) Afgooye and Wanlaweyn districts in Lower Shabelle (South West State), and Belet Weyne (Hiraan) where over 85 percent of the displacement has occurred. Somalia\u2019s marginalized communities and internally displaced persons are expected to most severely be affected by the impact of the floods. An estimated 132,000 hectares (ha) of agricultural land and 294 villages along the Shabelle River have been affected by the Hagaa floods. New displacements and further disruption to livelihoods are expected as foreseen moderate to heavy rainfall in the Ethiopian highlands are likely to raise Shabelle River levels over the coming weeks, likely resulting in additional flooding in the middle and lower reaches of the Shabelle. Of particular concern is Jowhar town and its environs in Middle Shabelle, where the river level is near the full crest, and other riverine towns in the Lower Shabelle region. Thus, in this project ZAMZAM foundation aims to extend immediate support to the flood-affected most vulnerable men, women, and children including disabilities and marginalized communities and IDPs in Jowhar district through immediate support to food access, protect their livelihoods, support local food production, and prevent the adoption of crisis strategies. In order to reach the objective of the project ZAMZAM will carry the following activities: \n(1) Increase access to food and improve nutrition through Unconditional cash transfer to 555 HHS representing 3,330 most vulnerable groups of the community in Jowhar district including widows, women head HH, families with disabilities, or with severe prolonged illness, and isolated families without external support. The supporting period will be 3 months and the rate is 60% of Minimum Expenditure Basket (MEB) which corresponding to 60 USD. (2) Restore the livelihood to 2,310 flood-affected vulnerable farmers through the distribution of agricultural input, to start their farming activities, protect their livelihoods, support local food production, and prevent adaption of crisis strategies. The selection criteria of the project beneficiaries will be: (1) Women headed households, (2) households with disabilities, (3) households with malnourished children and women (4) poor households, and (5) households with farming lands. \nDuring the selection of the beneficiaries, ZAMZAM will consult with the line ministry, district local authority, community leaders, women groups, disabled people, marginalized communities, and religious groups, in order to make the selection fair, transparency, and accountability.\n\n(3) To keep the sustainability of the project and increase the production of the beneficiaries, ZAMZAM will train selected 200 lead farmers to share equally men and women from the target farmers on the best technologies and methodologies to increase their livelihoods production.\n\nThe project will seek to increase food supply, reduce hunger, counter rising food prices, and improve responses to food emergency crisis by extending the area of land cultivated under good agricultural practices. The project will use a similar approach to improve the use of adapted varieties, early planting, correct sowing, use of soil enhancing plant species, observing rotations, precision fertilizer placement and timely application, correct spacing, timely weeding, and post-harvest storage.",

The appeal to the United Nations for support is a matter of urgency as those two referral facilities are facing a dire need to keep power stability while treating and testing patients with COVID-19.  \nThe RC/HC has decided to use the Humanitarian response funds to finance the support and requested UNDP to handle the procurement process to provide the generators. From the quotations already sought by the OPM, the estimate cost for the two generators is USD 160,000 including delivery and installation. UNDP is currently launching its own competitive sourcing to come up with financial proposals for contracting the supplier with the best value for money. Before a contract is signed, a budget should be available in Atlas, hence this submission in GMS to secure funding.",

Community awareness and mobilization campaigns on AWD/cholera will be conducted through activities such as mass media campaigns (radio and billboards), health and hygiene promotion at health facilities, community outreach through a cadre of trained health promoters, and leveraging community health committees to disseminate critical messages on outbreak prevention. In collaboration with the Ministry of Health (MOH), the project will also strengthen and expand early warning disease detection mechanisms to mitigate, detect, and respond to disease outbreaks in a timely manner. Case tracing from health facility data with ensure the timely follow up and mitigation before outbreaks occur. \n\nThe project will deliver the Essential Package of Health Services (EPHS) to fill the critical maternal, reproductive, and child health service gaps and treat communicable diseases, common illnesses, HIV/STIs, and tuberculosis. Hygiene promotion activities will specifically reach households with sick and malnourished children through targeted and timely health and hygiene messages. At the four proposed static facilities, clinical staff have been trained on clinical management of rape (CMR), GBV referral pathways, psychosocial support (PSS), and data confidentiality. Each proposed health facility serves as an entry point to the connected women\u2019s and girls\u2019 safe space where vulnerable women and girls may, upon request, access PSS and referrals to specialized GBV services including CMR \n\nMultiple feedback channels will be established to ensure accountability and responsive programming. RI will communicate the availability of all feedback mechanisms and beneficiary right to share. RI adheres to the Somali Treatment Guidelines, actively participates in cluster and coordination meetings, submits data on a monthly basis, and relies on national and MoH staff expertise to implement program activities. Through close collaboration with other partners in Beletweyne, RI will work to minimize redundancy and maximize impact.",

        "description": "According to FSNAU Post Deyr 2019/2020 technical assessment, the overall health, food security and nutrition needs remain significant within most parts of Somalia with an estimated 43% of rural Nugal and Burtinle population in urgent need of humanitarian assistance (73,433 people, among them 2,073 in emergency, 21,350 in crisis and 50,010  being stressed. Nugaal region has consistently reported poor maternal amp child health and nutrition indicators ridden by high child and maternal morbidity rates, crude mortality rates and under 5 mortality rates. In December 2019, EPHS project that supported health and nutrition intervention in Nugaal came to a close. This left ta gap in health and nutrition in Nugaal. The Proposed project  will therefore bridge the major essential health care service gap that currently exists in Burtinle following the close out of the EPHS Project. The  project will  address the identified gaps in nutrition and health, enhancing access to integrated basic health and nutrition care services within their localities aimed at improving the physical and mental well-being of boys, girls, men and women in the targeted locations.  These specific needs have been outlined in the HNO, HRP and FSNAU and MOH gaps identified in the targeted locations. The proposed project is geared towards reducing the vulnerability of the beneficiaries and communities. World Vision Somalia (WV Som)  will work  with MOH to address the health and nutrition gaps identified. The services will be both preventive and curative targeting vulnerable men, women, boys, girls and persons living with physical disabilities in the 2 targeted districts. 1 Mobile and outreach implementation models will be adopted to address the unique needs of vulnerable beneficiaries in remote and geographically isolated populations in  Burtinle district.  Screening for malnutrition will be carried out and children with SAM will be treated in OTP sites. Children with MAM will be  registered through SCOPE to access  TSFP that is supported by WFP. Children diagnosed with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) with medical complication will be referred to the  SCs that World Vision propose to support in Burtinle  district.  At each of the 4  MCHs, WVI shall establish basic reproductive health care services aligned within the MISP framework, utilizing the ambulances to refer mothers with complications from the MCHs and PHUs to the hospitals. At each PHU WV shall build the capacity of the community midwives to provide basic reproductive health care services in remote hard to reach areas as a mitigation measure against preventable maternal morbidity and mortality. While engaging community volunteers, WV shall adopt Timed and targeted counselling (TTC) approach focusing on pre conception to the first 1000 days of a child\u2019s life also incorporating the Finish baby kit and Fortified rice and lentils (Vitameal) as a motivator for adoption of promoted health seeking practices among WCBA through enhancing access to Reproductive health care services, child health including Immunization ,IYCF and hygiene promotion care and care-giver led MUAC screening and referral . At 4 targeted MCHs and PHUs WV has an already established GBV care system with personnel already trained and necessary CMR supplies in place to respond to GBV cases.  World Vision will ensure that beneficiaries visiting the targeted facilities including beneficiaries served at the mobile sites access a comprehensive basic package of services .Towards health and nutrition promotion, World Vision will focus on NHHP, care-giver led MUAC screening that will be done at the project sites with the nutrition beneficiaries is linked with the food security and safety net interventions to enhance household food basket.",

It is also contributing to the cluster priority of filling critical gaps in health care services for populations facing high incidence of malnutrition and service gaps.\nThe project has also been designed with full awareness of the prevailing gender norms and deeply rooted gender inequalities in Somalia that limit women and girls from accessing basic services such as health and nutrition, and expose them to a higher risk of GBV. In order to address these challenges, Save the Children will identify and work to remove the physical, cognitive and social barriers by collaborating closely with the communities and particularly the influencers and gatekeepers. We will also address the intersectionality of vulnerability factors, for example women with disabilities or from minor clans who are likely to face multiple levels of discrimination.\nThe project will contribute to improving equitable access to quality life-saving curative and preventative health and nutrition services through the support of static health facilities complemented by mobile outreach services. There will be one integrated health and nutrition mobile team in Garowe district. The integrated health and nutrition mobile team will provide outpatient consultations, routine immunizations, maternal healthcare, disease surveillance and health promotion as well as systematic identi\ufb01cation, referral and treatment of acutely malnourished cases by providing integrated nutrition services to out-patient therapeutic programme (OTP), Targeted Supplementary Feeding Program (TSFP) and stabilization centers. The provision of OTP services for those with Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) and the referral and treatment of SAM cases with medical complications to the nearest stabilization centre. Micronutrient supplementation, promotion of Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF) practices, promotion of adoption of good hygiene and sanitation practices will be done, providing treatment for all age groups, both male and female. The health and nutrition interventions will improve early identification and prevention of malnutrition, and access to primary health care, and therefore reduce excess morbidity and mortality. As part of gender and social norms transformation we will ensure that the activities include positive messaging for men in their roles as fathers. Women and girls will be seen by health practitioners of the same sex and consultations and documentation will be kept confidential.\nSave the Children (SC) will support nine fixed facilities in the following locations Waabari MCH, Gabmbool MCH, Gargar MCH, Jilab MCH, Barwaaqo MCH,Bahnano 1 MCH, Bahnano 2 MCH, Hanano MCH and Awrculus MCH    with integrated health and nutrition services in addition to the mobile and iCCM services. SC will carry out regular safety audits of the facilities to identify and mitigate the risks faced by women and girls in accessing services and resources.\nWe would like to note that Save the Children is working closely with partners to monitor and respond to the ongoing COVID 19 pandemic and will plan to modify and adapt programme activities according to the emerging situation if necessary. Save the Children will be considering the four following dimensions and is currently developing plans for staff health, business continuity, programme preparedness and programme response.",

        "title": "Providing Integrated Health and WASH services to marginalized and vulnerable IDP and Host communities in Burdhubo",
        "description": "Trocaire has been the main provider of Health services in Gedo since 1992, operating all main hospitals in northern Gedo in partnership with District Health Boards and, more recently, the Ministry of Health. This proposed intervention will provide integrated lifesaving Health and WASH services to 3,987 men, 3,767 women, 3,588 boys, and 3,404 girls from Burdhubo location in Garbaharey district. These will include approximately 7,373 IDPs, 7,373 host community members, and 730 individuals with different forms of disability. Trocaire will work closely with the government District Medical Officers, the Burdhubo District Health Board, the District Commissioner's office, other implementing partners and with coordination through the Health and WASH clusters. Coordination will be prioritized as it remains a key assumption of the project for effective and efficient delivery of integrated lifesaving assistance to vulnerable and marginalized populations in Burdhubo. Health interventions aim to provide primary and essential lifesaving services in an inclusive manner. With a few private health facilities in Burdhubo, the population remains under-served, with children, pregnant and lactating mothers facing unimaginable challenges as they walk long distances of up to 40 kilometres to access health services. Trocaire will therefore work with the above stakeholders to re-establish affordable, accessible, and inclusive health services to both vulnerable IDP and host communities. This will require minor rehabilitation of 1 static health facility- Burdhubo Health Centre, and equipment and management of 1 mobile outreach team that will access beneficiaries in 5 outreach sites. Waiting shades will be constructed in these five sites to ensure dignified assistance is provided in a safe, accessible environment. Health workers will be trained to handle different components of health activities including Clinical Management of Rape, immunizations, emergency trauma care, communicable disease treatment, TB screening and treatment etc. Specialized services, which require referral to nearby hospitals, will be facilitated. The Trocaire-managed health facility in Garbaharey town will be the main referral point, as it is equipped as a referral hospital.\nWASH services will complement health services through relations with the health outreach teams, working closely to reduce morbidity and mortality rates, as well as reducing cases of malnutrition. Preventive approaches will be utilized through 11 hygiene promotion sessions with community-based staff/ volunteers. Hand-washing practices will be promoted through distribution of 1,000 hygiene kits through restricted cash vouchers in collaboration with the WASH cluster hub, as well as other partners on the ground, if any. According to assessment data collected in early March 2020, about 90 percent of the population in Burdhubo use untreated and unsafe water from the river, which is also too far a distance for most of the HHs. Within this project, Trocaire will seek to construct one hybrid shallow well with water treatment encouraged at the household level to encourage uptake of safe and clean water. One representative Water-User Management Committees (WMCs) will be set up to manage the shallow wells created. 70 emergency latrines will be constructed and hand-washing facilities with soap installed. Hygiene promotion sessions will be held. Trocaire is discussing with other partners to ensure that once this project is operational there will be opportunities to continue implementing necessary services, and working closely with the local, regional and national stakeholders to ensure that they are well equipped to continue provision of these services, when time is right for Trocaire to exit.",

        "description": "Evictions represent a unique protection challenge in Somalia with far-reaching consequences on physical security, dignity, and livelihood of victims. Bossosa is one of the epicenters of the problem as the region struggles to recover from the residual effects of the 2016-17 drought amid persistent insecurity, cyclic natural disasters, and widespread unlawful evictions. At the national level, Somalia is faced with the daunting prospect of rebuilding the country having been riven by more than two decades of conflict and lawlessness. Important strides are being made to address the issue but ongoing initiatives have been outmatched due to the prevalence of the problem, thus necessitating a more robust, integrated and coordinated program response. In the absence of an effective response to address protection challenges that are being exacerbated by eviction, displaced communities will remain at risk of continuing secondary displacements. Efforts to strengthen protection and contribute to durable solutions to displacement in Bossaso will be incomplete and/or undermined without addressing the issue of eviction concurrently and systematically. The project seeks to contribute towards ensuring that individuals affected by displacement receive support assistance to improve their tenure security situation and address post-eviction complications.\n\nThis action builds on NRC\u2019s hands on expertise in evictions prevention and response programming in Somalia, and targeting 37,198 individuals in Bossaso, the project seeks to enhance the protection of displaced communities at risk of eviction and to create an enabling environment for sustained recovery and the pursuit of log lasting solutions. This overarching objective will be achieved by implementing a combination of complementary activities aimed at reducing the practice of unlawful evictions, strengthening tenure security among displaced communities at highest risk of eviction, and consolidating the protection of HLP rights. Priority actions include supporting the establishment of dedicated evictions prevention capacities at the municipality of Bossaso, replicating eviction programming best practices at the municipality, helping victims cope with post-eviction stress through cash, and strengthening local dispute resolution capacities and fostering social cohesion in target communities. A parallel objective of the HLP Sub Cluster which this project will seek to advance is consolidating HLP capacity among national organization.\n\nA combination of deliverables will contribute toward the mitigation of protection risks exacerbated by evictions through integrated prevention and response initiatives ensuring that displaced communities have increased access to information and specialized services necessary to navigate administrative and procedural obstacles linked to the enjoyment and exercise of HLP rights and supporting local mechanisms to address HLP violations and contribute to social cohesion.",

Where market conditions allow based on survey data, AVORD will adapt a Cash-based approach to implementation otherwise, an in-kind, direct distribution modality will be adapted. Disbursement of relief items will be made in close coordination with the shelter cluster to ensure that available stocks are used to respond to crisis and that activities contribute to the attainment of cluster strategic objectives. In each distribution, priority will be given to most vulnerable households in humanitarian emergency including the disabled, the chronically-ill, female headed households and families with the largest number of children under the age of 5. Full beneficiary details such as contact information will be captured throughout the process to facilitate monitoring activities and ensure that aid is given to those in need. Within 4 to 8 weeks of each distribution, a Post Distribution Monitoring Exercise (PDM) will be conducted to assess the effectiveness of the response and document lessons learnt. \n\nIn the delivery of the proposed package, AVORD will seek integration with own interventions in the region and with other humanitarian partners including NRC and DRC with whom AVORD has signed a memorandum of cooperation, to ensure complementarity, value for money and efficiency of the response.",

The target population (women, girls, men, boys, elderly and people with disabilities) living in the IDP site reside in small makeshift structures made of sub-standard materials that jeopardize their physical security, privacy, and from vagaries of nature and diseases. \n\nUnder this project, HAPEN will distribute 3954 NFIs and 3954 ESKs as in-kind to 9 IDP site in Gedo region Dollow: (Kabasa = 655, Qansahley = 550, Host 100), Luuq: Jazeera =314, Xero kowad= 470 and Boyle=420 Host =100), and Garbahrey: (Towfiq =270, Tula qorah =345, Hashi Weer =380, Tafta taag =250 and Host 100).\n\nBeneficiaries will be selected through a participatory process driven by a representative project and site management committees while ensuring marginalized groups interests are catered for and vulnerable approach, considering issues such as women-headed and child-headed households, orphans, disabled, the old among and new arrivals, protracted, and distribution.\n\nThe proposed intervention targets 3654 IDP HHs (21,924 IDP persons) and 300 IDP host HHs (1,800) in Dollow, Garbaharey and Luuq. The protracted IDPs targeted are those living in Grabahrey. These families belong to most vulnerable IDPs who live in makeshift buuls without adequate access to NFIs and Emergency Shelter. \n\nFollowing a need-based and transparent selection of beneficiaries and on local market conditions, HAPEN will facilitate a direct-distribution program through which targeted IDPs and select host communities will receive ESKs and NFIs. HAPEN will employ an owner-driven approach in the construction of emergency shelters by capacitating the IDPs to undertake the construction process.\n\nProtection and GBV concerns will be factored during site selection and will be integrated in all aspects of the response. Proper site planning will be undertaken to ensure effective mitigation of hazards and reduce alarming congestion levels in target settlements.\n\nOn monitoring and evaluation, Post Distribution Monitoring (PDM) and Post Construction Monitoring (PCM) will be conducted after distribution and construction respectively. Therefore, two PDM exercises will be conducted for the two phases of NFI distributions. The monitoring exercise will provide beneficiary feedback on the effectiveness and collate lessons of the distribution. 90% of the beneficiaries will take part in the exercise to ensure proper representation and accurate reflection on the process and quality of the intervention. \n\nThe PDM will support measuring beneficiary satisfaction of the items distributed and identify the needs and feelings of the community better. The exercises will inform on the effectiveness of the activities and achievements of targets while providing guidance towards the overall objective. \n\n3 Community Response and Feedback Mechanism (CRFM) desks, one for each district of operation will be established, in addition to the hotline and PDM /PCM.

With the presence of the Somali National Army (SNA) and AMISOM, Al Shabab, and clan militia, the security situation in the region had become more volatile than it was before. Security operations carry out by SNA and AMISOM alongside the USA drone airstrike targeting Alshabaab Militia caused humanitarian consequences to the civilians in the region. Within March 2020, joint forces SNA/AMISOM took over Janale village as a strategic business center it is about 13KM to Marka district. As a result, an estimated number of 3,200 HHs mainly women, children, and elderly people have fled from Janale to the IDPs in Marka, Afgoye villages as well as Mogadishu to escape from the violence. \nThus, based on findings from rapid needs assessment through direct surveys of IDPs in Marka villages and telephone interviews with IDPs in Afgoye villages conducted by HINNA team in the region, this project is assigned to address emergency shelter and NFIs needs of 2,216 IDP families (13,296 people) of the newly conflict and flood affected population including those protracted IDP families who have recently received any shelter and NFIs assistance in 10 IDP sites in the areas with high severity and people in need \u2013 5 in Afgoye namely Aytire, Baalguri, Damaley, Sagaalaad, and Mareereey and 5 in Marka namely Buulo Samoow, Buufoow Bacaad, Moallin Ali, Abukar Same, and Cell Fareey who are in dire need of shelter and NFIs assistance as they live in bushes that endanger their lives and dignity. During beneficiary registration, the project will give more priority to most vulnerable and marginalized groups such as IDPs with larger families, families with disabled and elderly persons, female headed-households and etc.\nAlthough markets in both districts are functioning the main challenge is that IDP settlements are far from them. However, according to the preference of project target IDP community including existing camp management committees, camp leaders and local authorities who participated in consultation meeting conducted through direct observation and phone interviews about the modality of assistance, this project will use in-kind distribution modality of 2,216 ESKs and 2,216 NFIs to project direct target beneficiaries of 2,216 HHs (13,296 persons) in both districts. In the context of COVID 19, decongestion and site planning/rearranging shelters will be considered in consultation with IDP communities and in close coordination with the cluster. \nDuring the implementation, the project will ensure using cluster guidelines to improve the living condition of the targeted beneficiaries by restoring their privacy, protection, and dignity. Post Distribution Monitoring (PDM) will be conducted four to six weeks after to assess the quality of the distribution and process, utilization, and its immediate impact in saving lives and the satisfaction of beneficiaries about the NFI items distributed and/or the shelters constructed and it's quality. This will help us know more about the future preference of IDP communities.\nThe main objective of the project is to ensure that 13,296 persons (2,216 HHs) of newly displaced, and protracted IDPs affected by conflict and natural disasters have the protection from the weather and have privacy through the provision of 2,216 Emergency Shelter (ESKs) and 2,216 NFI kits to 2,216 households (13,296 persons: (1,728 men, 2,925 women, 3,324 boys, and 5,319 girls)). The project will ensure full coordination among humanitarian service provides especially shelter cluster partners who are working in the project areas in order to avoid duplications.",

        "description": "In close coordination with NRC and DRC, AVORD has developed this proposal with the aim of delivering a holistic, integrated response to provide life-saving services to vulnerable communities in Xudur. As elaborated in the attached teaming agreement, AVORD will take lead in the provision of Non-Food Items, emergency shelters and CCCM services in Xudur while DRC and NRC will undertake complementary WASH and Protection activities respectively. Tentative implementation arrangements have been endorsed by the three agencies with a commitment to coordinate closely and target a similar target group, hence maximizing impact and efficiency of this response.\n\nUnder the present proposal, AVORD will distribute NFIs on-Food Items (NFIs) to 4,700 IDP and host community households (estimated 28,200 persons) who live in extremely poor shelter conditions. The target group include 6,768 men, 9,024 women, 3,384 boys and 3,384 girls from the IDP community and 1,692 men, 2,256 women, 846 boys and 846 girls from host communities. Of the target group, an estimated 846 men, 1,128 women, 423 boys and 423 girls will be targeted based on disability. Each registered household will be provided with 1 NFI kit comprising of 1 Plastic Sheet, 3 Blankets, 2 Sleeping Mats, 1 Kitchen Set, 1 Mosquito Net, 1 Solar Lamp and 2 Jerry Cans with the capacity of 10 Liters each. In addition to NFIs, emergency shelters will be constructed for 250 newly arrived IDPs and those living in the open. In the construction of these shelters, the project team will ensure adequate separation between individual household shelters and that pathways exist to provide all-weather access to individual dwellings and facilities. AVORD will closely coordinate with district officials and relevant line ministries at state and national levels to secure land tenure for a minimum of 3 years. The number of emergency shelters to be constructed under this project has been limited to 250 since the majority of IDPs reside in private land, making it difficult to secure enough space for the construction of a large number of shelters. However, it is anticipated that IDPs will be able to use the plastic sheets that will provided as part of the NFI kit to repair damages to their current shelters.\n\nWith regards to CCCM, AVORD will setup and strengthen camp governance structures where necessary to enhance information-sharing and trigger system-wide coordination among service providers. Key program activities also include construction of 2 culturally-appropriate multi-purpose social halls to provide space for improved coordination and effective management of sites. Periodic service mapping, site monitoring and safety audits will be undertaken in close coordination with NRC, DRC, the CCCM cluster and other humanitarian partners in the area to effectively address existing gaps and maximize efficiency of the humanitarian response. Site maintenance committees in target settlements will be equipped with a range of site maintenance tools and supplies before engaging in cash-for-work schemes through which community-led site upkeep and maintenance activities will be carried out.\n\nAVORD will adapt systematic approach to beneficiary selection with a clear criterion to prioritize the marginalized, single headed-households, large families and/or families with children under the age of 5, women at risk as identified by protection officers and those with special needs. Data collected to inform beneficiary selection will be segregated by gender to ensure that no group is left-out. List of beneficiaries along with their contact numbers will be availed to SHF and other actors responding in the area to avoid overlap. The effectiveness of the aid package will be ascertained through Post Distribution Monitoring exercise thus ensuring that beneficiaries access their services safely and in a dignified manner. An elaborate feedback and complain mechanism will be setup to ensure accountability to the affected population.",

        "description": "IDP communities in Bardera face cyclical scarcity to safe and sufficient water due to abnormal dryness and floods. At this critical moment, vulnerable communities rely on unsafe water for drinking and domestic use, leading to increased health risks and poor living standards. Floods further undermine the sanitation services available in Bardera. During the most recent floods in October 2019, 90 percent of latrines were non-functional due to the floods leading to high rates of open defecation and increased incidences of water-borne diseases. To reverse the negative impact of recent natural hazards and increase the resilience of Bardera IDP communities, a sustainable WASH intervention capable of withstanding these shocks and improving living standards is vital. \n\nACTED will respond to this compounded risk by implementing a market-based project in six largely underserved and high-WASH risk IDP sites in Bardera, including Bulo Ceesan, Bulo Garass, Liban, Xabalcadey, Horseed and Kulmiya IDP sites, and will serve 2634 households (15804 individuals). To ensure the sustainability of this action, ACTED will collaborate with the private sector to extend existing water networks to these communities and where necessary construct new water assets. Moreover, ACTED will construct flood-resistant and gender-sensitive latrines to ensure year-round use as well as the distribution of WASH vouchers, establishment of WASH Management Committees and hygiene sensitization sessions. The full suite of activities aims to meet both the acute and long-term needs of the vulnerable IDP communities, whilst establishing relationships with the private sector for continued maintenance and operation of these assets.",

The project is framed around four sector areas, Shelter, WASH, Camp Coordination and Camp Management (CCCM) and Protection. NRC will intervene in the WASH sector, DRC in Protection sector while AVORD in Shelter and CCCM sectors to complement each other's activities. The project will be targeting the same locations and beneficiaries in various settlements in Xudur district.\n\n A pre-teaming agreement has been uploaded/attached to this proposal (see attached Annex-1) providing further details on the approach and rationale of the collaboration. In essence, the multi-cluster, multi-sector and multi-agency approach, will maximize assistance as different sectors and actors will be able to share critical information and inform immediate programming and re-design of programs. This approach will be useful to create synergies of services and expertise within the same location and same population leading to achieving a greater impact. The interventions will support the targeted communities holistically and efficiently by providing well-tailored and packaged responses to address different needs of the people of concern. The integrated response is in line with SHF principles by prioritization direct implementation and supporting the integration of response across clusters. \n\n10 settlements will be targeted by all agencies (the name of these settlements are mentioned in attached Annex-3) and will reach 17,131 individuals (50% females) through WASH interventions that includes rehabilitation of existing productive shallow wells and installing them with complete Solar pumping system, construction of water storage facilities and distribution points. The project will improve sanitation and hygiene conditions of the target communities through construction of 450 family shared latrines with handwashing facilities, training of community based hygiene promoters to undertake awareness creation along with distribution of 1350 hygiene kits to displacement affected families. DRC will provide Protection assistance whereby AVORD will provide Shelter and CCCM assistance to the same beneficiaries. After the approval of the project, NRC and DRC will do joint needs assessment both in the district to select the most vulnerable settlements for interventions. Through this project, NRC will reach 17,131 individuals. Post Distribution, Monitoring (PDM) and post construction exercises will be carried out after 6 weeks of wash NFIs and construction of latrines to analyse the impact of the project.",

        "description": "In Lower Juba region and across Somalia, there are multiple threats to the health and resilience of the population due to inadequate WASH facilities. For water supply, Afmadow population is dependent on a mix of unprotected surface water sources and protected groundwater sources. Surface water sources are seasonal and usually contaminated, while protected groundwater supplies are either difficult to access to due to distance and/or not affordable due the high costs of extraction and the dominance of private sector entrepreneurs in their operation, often resulting in rates that the lower income communities cannot afford to access a minimum quantity of water per person per day (Sphere).\nIn this context, ARC will implement a WASH cluster-specific intervention aiming (1) Rehabilitation and/or extension of 5 existing water infrastructures to provide reliable and sustained access to safe water based on identified strategic community water points to flood affected communities in Afmadow district. (2) Establishment of 5 gender balanced water management committees for ensuring continuity of services, appropriate operation and maintenance and as well strengthen women participation in WASH projects. (3) Installation of new and/or rehabilitation of 600 sanitation facilities that are lockable from inside, gender segregated, with hand washing facilities, disaster sensitive with appropriate disaster mitigation features designs. As part of ensuring protection mainstreaming, ARC will install solar light near communal sanitation facilities or if this is not feasible will provide with individual household\u2019s solar lamp/torch. (4) Hygiene promotion campaigns focusing on hand washing with soap and hygiene kits distribution to enhance community sanitation and hygiene awareness and enable good practices. Significant amount of the above proposed WASH activities will be implemented through Market Based Programming (MBP) approach as to strengthen local markets. \n The proposed WASH project will complement set of emergency Health, Protection and livelihood interventions currently ongoing in the targeted areas of Afmadow district through other funding to ensure a comprehensive approach to reduction of morbidity and mortality associated with diseases and hazards resulting from deficient sanitation conditions, the lack of access to safe water and low level of good hygiene practices. ARC\u2019s WASH technical designs adhere to SPHERE standards/Somalia WASH cluster guidelines, mainstreaming protection and disability, gender considerations per IASC guidelines for GBV Interventions in Humanitarian settings as well as the environmental protection considerations and securing access to the elderly and those with special needs as per Handicap International Guidelines. Approximately 24,000 people (4,000 households) will benefit from this intervention. All ARC WASH programs are community led, and leverage stakeholder cooperation to ensure safe, equitable, and dignified access to WASH services for all. Under Health sector, ARC is supporting one MCH (Bosnia) in Dhobley and would start Outreach health services in Afmadow town targeting IDP sites with vulnerable individuals having difficult access to basic lifesaving health services. ARC would also provide un-conditional cash transfer to vulnerable groups in Dhobley for 3 months aiming to improve food security situation as well as the nutrition indicators. ARC\u2019s integrated approach combining the WASH intervention with health and nutrition components ensures greater impact in the area of operation. Adequate WASH improves the overall public health indicators, including the lower incidence of communicable diseases, reduced mother and child morbidity and stronger effects of nutrition interventions as a result of prevention of loss of valuable nutrients from diarrheal diseases.",

PAH, NoFYL and HINNA will implement a multi cluster intervention aiming at 1) CCCM: improving the coordination and information management at site level 2) WASH: addressing sustainable access to water, hygiene, and capacity building needs in this field 3) PROTECTION: mainstreaming protection through (a) preventing and response to eviction, including monitoring threats of evictions by assessing potential eviction sites, monitoring, documentation and reporting to relevant authorities and relevant cluster to mobilize support for advocacy (b) To advocacy and campaigns that aim to ensure lawful eviction processes (c) Capacity development of settlement managers, local authorities in the field of housing, land and proper protection monitoring through ensuring collection of information based on the methodology of the Somalia Protection Monitoring System (SPMS). 4) SHELTER: improving the IDPs living conditions through the distribution of emergency NFI kits and construction of Transitional shelters.\nActivities will be implemented by PAH, NoFYL and HINNA in 2 districts (Kaxda and Deynile) of Banadir region. Activities will target the most undeserved areas of these districts that host mostly newly displaced IDPs due to drought and conflicts. Approximately 17,400 people (3,283 men, 6505 Boys, 9,710 girls and 4,886 women) including 3658 people with disability will directly benefit from this intervention. It will also benefit an entire community working in targeted IDP sites, including local authorities, clusters and other organizations. The multi-sectoral approach and synergies enable the partners to concentrate services and expertise within the same location and same population, leading to a greater impact.\n\nMoreover, PAH acts as WASH Cluster co-lead at national cluster level, NoFYL is part of SRCs and member of CCCM and protection cluster, while HINNA is a member of shelter cluster in Banadir region. This allows to ensure a great capacity for project implementation and a strong understanding of the cluster strategy. Each partner will directly implement activities of their specialization sector. The coordination among partners will be done throughout an entire implementation process to ensure synergies and combine services delivery for all sectors. The partners will jointly conduct periodic monitoring activities to assess implementation of the project, collect feedback from beneficiaries and adjust implementation accordingly if needed. This will be done through harmonized tools that will be developed during the project kick-off meeting. Furthermore, NoFYL, while  providing protection services to IDPs, will also ensure that protection is mainstreamed throughout WASH activities conducted by PAH  as well as Shelter activities conducted by HINNA,  by providing relevant training and ensuring strong coordination.",

Moreover, the use of radio media will look to provide an additional layer of awareness and critical thinking related to community-based responses and prevention of COVID-19 transmission.  Partners will continue to forge synergies with organizations, civil society, and local authorities operating within targeted IDP sites to greatly strengthen, reinforce and harmonize COVID-19 risk communication and hardware activities that are occurring within Deynile and Hodan IDP sites. AVORD: Through joint collaboration, AVORD will provide site-level RCCE encapsulating the cluster\u2019s RCCE Plan and adapting efforts based on findings from the CCCM Cluster\u2019s RCCE Feedback Assessment. Implementation of a site-level complaints feedback mechanism (CFM) will occur with the system adhering to the cluster\u2019s standards and following guidelines put forth by the Community Engagement Working Group. SCC (separate proposal): Through joint collaboration, SCC will be working WASH partners to organize hygiene promotion activities supported by CCCM partners via mobilizing community members and certain targeted members of the IDP sites. When feasible, WASH partners will provide emergency WASH services to IDP sites (water supply, hygiene promotion-installation, of handwashing stations, and distribution of soap for handwashing to sites that do not have access to these services.

        "description": "According to OCHA flash floods report Since July, up to 166,379 people have been affected by flash floods in Afgooye, Marka and Wanlaweyn districts in Lower Shabelle region when riverbanks broke along River Shabelle. The floods have displaced in Wanlaweyn alone more than 82,000 people, inundated homes, wells and schools and destroyed large swathes of farmland and crops The heavy deyr rains ave caused massive population displacement, damaged housing, property, infrastructure and farm lands in riverine areas in southern Somalia. WASH Cluster has reported critical gaps in Balcad, Marka and Wanlaweyn where no WASH assistance has been received despite high risk levels for AWD.\nThe main aim of this project is to provide lifesaving WASH services to most vulnerable and underserved communities living in floods affected areas in Wanlaweyn district of Lower Shabelle Region. A total of 17,000 flood affected men, women and children including the disabilities, marginalized communities and IDPs will benefit safe drinking water and will have access equally throughout the project period.\n\nSOYDA in collaboration with the local authority, partnership with main water vendors in rural villages in Wanlaweyn district, will provide emergency water voucher to the 6,400 (1408 men, 1,536 women, 1,728 boys and 1,728 girls) targeted beneficiaries including people with disabilities and marginalized communities in the targeted IDP camps, which they can redeem for water at the specified water vendors (water trucks). The action also includes to hire water truck of a capacity of 6,000 liters of safe water to the targeted locations. Each voucher can be used to redeem specified quantity of safe water of 7.5 liters per person per day for a period of 30 days. The project will build the capacity of 1q WASH Committees (composing 4 men and 3 women per Committee) shared equally men and women on operation and maintenance of developed water infrastructures shall be throughout the project implementation period, to ensure the sustainability of the developed water facilities after the project is faced out. SOYDA will make sure that men, women, girls and boys including people with disabilities and marginalized community have equal access to the rehabilitated/constructed WASH services. SOYDA will upgrade/rehabilitate two boreholes equipped with hybrid to improve its water quality and reduce its running cost, in order to receive the community their water needs at an affordable cost. SOYDA will replace the engine powered boreholes in to hybrid system and construct 8 water kiosks nearer to the IDP settlements supplied water through piping network to avoid the risk of rape against women and girls in Wanlaweyn district. The project will provide reliable and sustainable access to environmental sanitation through construction of 100 IDP latrines in Wanlaweyn district. The latrines will be gender separated and flood proof with lockable doors and hand washing basins. construction of latrines will be implemented through market-based programming. \n\nSOYDA will distribute 80 sanitation sets to 10 IDP camps, in order to improve the environmental sanitation of the targeted locations. The aim of the sanitation sets distribution is to carry out clean-up campaigns, in order to reduce the spread of AWD/cholera diseases and to improve the environmental sanitation of the target locations. SOYDA will conduct comprehensive hygiene promotion campaigns focusing hand washing with soap practices to 17,000 men, women, boys and girls through visiting house to house, health facilities, and nutrition centers. SOYDA will also train 30 Community Hygiene Promoters (CHPs) shared equally men and women, selected from the target communities and IDPs, so that in their turn they can educate the entire population to change their behaviors. 1600 HP kits will be distributed to the most vulnerable and underserved communities in the target locations",

        "description": "Humanitarian situation in Middle Shabelle has deteriorated due ongoing flooding in last two consecutive rainy seasons and now communities in low lying areas along the Juba and Shabelle river valleys in south central Somalia are grappling with a new wave of flooding during Hagaa season due to the intensive rains started within the Ethiopian highlands. The worst affected districts by floods are Balcad, Jowhar and Mahaday in Middle Shabelle (Hirshabelle) Afgooye and Wanlaweyn distr icts in Lower Shabelle (South West State) and Belet Weyne (Hiraan) where over 85 per cent of the displacement has occurred. The flooding situation in Balcad district has resulted in massive displacement affecting particularly children, mothers and the elderly who are now facing serious hunger, health and protection risks in an area already receiving little to no humanitarian assistance due to insecurity. The floods have destroyed food reserves and threatened food markets. Significant gaps have been reported in flood-affected areas regarding to food, emergency shelter, non-food items, and safe drinking water, sanitation facilities and poor hygiene. Mothers, children, and the elderly as well as disabled people are extra affected due to the fact that displacement puts them at risk of exploitation since they lack their normal income routines and familiar environment. People are at a high risk of hunger and illness such as water-borne diseases which has already been reported in some of the flood affected areas. The impact of the ongoing flooding in Hirshabelle compounded by economic and social impacts of COVID-19 and forecast of below-average Gu rainfall from October to December 2020 may result in further deterioration of humanitarian outcomes for affected communities through 2021. The proposed project aims to save the lives of affected communities in Balcad district and enhance resilience building by provide safe, equitable and sustainable access to safe and sufficient water for drinking, cooking, personal, and domestic (15L/p/day) through by drilling and construction of 1 borehole and rehabilitation of 3 boreholes and 5 shallow wells, construction of 100 flood proof latrines that consider the disable people, distribution of hygiene and sanitation kits to improve sanitation conditions and establishment and train water management committees to the operation and maintenance of the facilities. The project will target the most vulnerable households (men, women boys and girls) affected  differently by the ongoing floods but give special attention to female-headed households, the  elderly and people living with disability. Market-based programming (MBP) will be considered in all the activities to strengthen and working with existing markets supply chains and service providers in project target areas to meet the needs of crisis-affected populations.GSA has extensive experience of working in the WASH sector within Balcad district and can mobilize rapidly due to strong links with communities and government.",

        "description": "The impact of the ongoing flooding compounded by economic and social impacts of COVID-19 escalated conflict, and forecast of below-average Gu rainfall from October to December 2020 may result in further deterioration of humanitarian outcomes for affected communities through 2021. The floods have been triggered by heavy, above-average rainfall locally and in upstream areas in the Ethiopian highlands and have affected Gedo, Hiraan, Middle Juba, and Middle and Lower Shabelle regions. The floods have been triggered by heavy, above-average rainfall locally and in upstream areas in the Ethiopian highlands and have affected Gedo, Hiraan, Middle Juba, and Middle and Lower Shabelle regions. The floods temporarily displaced households to higher grounds in several prone areas including Belet Weyne. The recurrent floods have inundated the roads, WASH infrastructures, crops, houses and etc. A cholera outbreak fueled by limited access to safe drinking water, poor sanitation, and displacement has already been reported in some of the flood-affected districts, underscoring the need for urgent repair and rehabilitation to damaged WASH infrastructure and the provision of clean water. More cases of acute watery diarrhea (AWD) are being reported in children under five years old, who are particularly vulnerable to disease, especially if their immune systems are compromised by malnutrition. Thus, in this project, AADSOM will improve access to safe water, sanitation facilities and promote good hygiene practices to reduce the negative impacts of the flood in the Belet Weyne town and 9 villages in Belet Weyne district to 19,000 women, men, boys, and girls including people with disabilities, minorities and most vulnerable underserved communities. Key activities AADSOM would like to undertake within this project the following WASH services:\nWater:\n- Provision of safe water to 1,000 households representing 6,000 men, women and children affected population through water vendors (water trucking) by using Water Voucher (WV) \n- Rehabilitation/construction of 29 flood-damaged shallow wells with hand pumps.\n- Establishment and capacity building training to gender-balanced 29 WASH committees and 58 Well Operators shared equally by men and women, to ensure continuity of service, operation, and maintenance, coupled training on DDR and conflict resolution mechanisms as cross-cutting\n\nHygiene and Sanitation:\nLack of access to adequate and appropriate sanitation and hygiene poses a serious threat to public health. The practice of open defecation is a leading cause of fecal-oral transmission of diseases with children being the most vulnerable. A safe and appropriate latrine accompanied by handwashing with soap provides an effective barrier to the transmission of diseases. The provision of appropriate facilities for defecation is also an essential response for people\u2019s dignity, safety, health, and well-being. To improve safe access to sanitation it is necessary to meet standards of privacy and safety of women and girls against GBV using sanitation structures that are locally or culturally acceptable. never the less, the disabilities will be given a special design that is appropriate and acceptable for use. in this project, AADSOM will: \n\n- Conduct comprehensive hygiene promotion campaigns to reach 19,000 men, women, boys, and girls through visiting house to house, schools, health centers, and feeding centers \n-Train 10 community hygiene promoters (5 men and 5 women), who will carry out hygiene promotion activities during and after the project is faced out \n-Distribute of 1,000 HP kits to 1,000 households with vulnerable men, women, and children, and\n- Construct 263 gender-sensitive and flood-proof latrines for the most affected community including latrines for disabled people in ensuring the sustainability of the latrines during floods.",

        "description": "Merka communities face scarcity of safe and sufficient water due to abnormal dryness and floods coupled with the effect of pandemic since march 2020. At this critical moment, vulnerable communities rely on unsafe water for drinking and domestic use, leading to increased health risks and poor living standards. Floods further undermine the sanitation services available in Merka and its environs. During the most recent floods in August 2020, over 60 percent of latrines were non-functional due to the floods leading to high rates of open defecation and increased incidences of water-borne diseases. To reverse the negative impact of recent natural hazards and increase the resilience of Merka IDP and host communities, a sustainable WASH intervention capable of withstanding these shocks and improving living standards is vital. ARD will respond to this compounded risk by implementing living saving WASH services in six largely underserved and high-WASH risk IDP sites in Merka, including Ceel xaaji, Ceel Ahmed ,Shalaamboot,Horseed and Ceel Jaale IDP sites, and will serve 3,000 households (18,000 individuals). The below proposed WASH activities are fully aligned with allocation strategy for flood response and as well as WASH cluster response strategy detailed in HRP 2020\nWater \nThrough water voucher assistance for a period of 60 days, provide safe drinking water to 1,300 flood affected families who have no access to clean water, or their water points are unsafe for drinking and needs disinfection and rehabilitation\nConstruction/rehabilitation 20 unprotected shallow wells installed with hand pumps. ARD will ensure the all rehabilitated wells will have infrastructures that can resist future floods. \nTo ensure the sustainability of rehabilitated water infrastructures, 20 WASH committees and 40 well operators will be trained on operation and management of water facilities.\nSanitation\nConstruction of 140 gender separated and desludgable flood proof latrines with lockable doors and handwashing facilities benefitting a total of 4,200 flood/AWD/cholera affected people. Around 7% (i.e. 10) of flood proof latrines will be allocated and designed for people living with disabilities (PWDS).\nCarry out environmental sanitation services to all project target locations especially IDP camps to improve all preventive measures against the risks of AWD/cholera outbreaks in Merka district, 4,500 people will benefit the environmental sanitation services by conducting mass clean-Up campaigns to manage solid waste in IDPs and host populated settlements. ARD will procure and distribute 60 sanitation tools to support the cleanup campaigns. \nHygiene\nUsing MBP/CVA modality, distribute 2,000 hygiene kits to reach 12,000 people affected by the floods or at risk of AWD/cholera in Merka district. The hygiene kit will constitute the following items: 200 aqua tabs, 1 Jerry can (20l Capacity), 1 bucket (20l capacity) and 5 bars of soaps (each 800mg) and 1 box of female sanitary item.\nConduct comprehensive hygiene promotion activities focusing on behavior change including hand washing with soap practices at critical times through health hygiene education campaigns targeting 18,000 people.\nTrain 10 Community Hygiene Promoters (50% female and 50% male) to conduct hygiene promotion session in project target areas\nTo ensure the sustainability of this action, ARD will collaborate with the affected communities and other humanitarian actors to ensure the affected population are provided with sufficient clean water services through water trucking for a period of 60 days, ARD will ensure to use voucher system through selection of the most vulnerable populations in Merka. Moreover, ARD will construct flood-resistant and gender-sensitive latrines to ensure year-round use as well as the distribution of WASH kits through vouchers, establishment of WASH Management Committees and hygiene sensitization sessions.",

This request was based on Oxfam Novib's work in Somalia to date, but intended to be more widely directed atthe entire civil society sector and the specific context in which it is operating in a post-conflict country. The program started with consulting local organisations in Somalia and Somaliland to get a complete picture of the sectors and regions where they are active, the challenges they face and the relationship between civil society, local political structures and the private sector. A program was then developed to strengthen the institutional development of Oxfam Novib's partners and those of other Oxfams, as well as a range of new NGOs.\nIn the first year local consultants were trained in Somalia. They were then seconded to civil society organisations to build their capacity in financial and organisational management. Furthermore, workshops were organised on specific themes suchas human rights and the role of civil society in the Somali context. The Liaison Office is now going to support the expansion of the program, focussing on strengthening both organisation and project management, while facilitating more training in the fields of civic education, governance, human rights and women's rights, HIV and AIDS and child protection.\nOver the years, the Somalia Country Office has expanded its intervention on short term humanitarian response as well as development development interventions. In 2015/2016, a decision was reached to move the Country Programme operation, which was largely in Nairobi, from Nairobi to Hargeisa. The country office has a small office in Nairobi , Kenya and large operations office in Hargeisa, Somaliland."

The Anticipatory Response Fund serves as a means for local humanitarian partners to quickly access funding to respond to sudden crises and emergencies. The fund's aim is to address funding gaps andensure quick access to emergency funding for local responders.

                "In 2004 Oxfam Novib set up a Liaison Office in Nairobi, Kenya in order to support the Strengthening Somali Civil Society Program, at the request of the EU. This request was based on Oxfam Novib's work in Somalia to date, but intended to be more widely directed atthe entire civil society sector and the specific context in which it is operating in a post-conflict country. The program started with consulting local organisations in Somalia and Somaliland to get a complete picture of the sectors and regions where they are active, the challenges they face and the relationship between civil society, local political structures and the private sector. A program was then developed to strengthen the institutional development of Oxfam Novib's partners and those of other Oxfams, as well as a range of new NGOs.\nIn the first year local consultants were trained in Somalia. They were then seconded to civil society organisations to build their capacity in financial and organisational management. Furthermore, workshops were organised on specific themes suchas human rights and the role of civil society in the Somali context. The Liaison Office is now going to support the expansion of the program, focussing on strengthening both organisation and project management, while facilitating more training in the fields of civic education, governance, human rights and women's rights, HIV and AIDS and child protection.\nOver the years, the Somalia Country Office has expanded its intervention on short term humanitarian response as well as development development interventions. In 2015/2016, a decision was reached to move the Country Programme operation, which was largely in Nairobi, from Nairobi to Hargeisa. The country office has a small office in Nairobi , Kenya and large operations office in Hargeisa, Somaliland."

        "description": "Somalia\u2019s population is currently experiencing multiple shocks (\u2018triple threat\u2019 \u2013 locust, drought, COVID-19): the Desert Locust upsurge that started in late 2019  and continues to threaten the food security and livelihoods of pastoralists and farmers in many parts of the country; riverine and flash floods that affect the food security, livelihoods and safety of farmers and people living in flood-prone, populated areas; the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic that is having severe health and socio-economic impacts both in Somalia and globally; and the extended impact of previous shocks (flooding, drought, displacement, etc.) on livelihoods.\nAssessments by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), Food Security and Nutrition Analysis Unit (FSNAU) and Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWSNET) also indicate that, in the absence of humanitarian assistance, up to 2.1 million people across Somalia are expected to face food consumption gaps or depletion of assets indicative of Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or worse outcomes through December 2020.In addition, 849 900 children under the age of five are likely to be acutely malnourished through August 2021 . Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are expected from June to September in parts of central Somalia, where livestock holdings are lowest, and in northeasternSomalia, where the economy is more dependent on livestock, seafood, and frankincense exports. The socioeconomic impacts of COVID-19have led to a 30-50 % decline in annual external remittances, an anticipated 25-35 % decline in annual livestock exports, lower labour demand, and above average imported staple food prices.\nBesides adverse weather conditions and conflict resulting in food insecurity and hunger, other prevailing challenges in the project areas Oxfam and partners Candlelight, Havoyoco and KAALO work are poor access to water and inadequate hygiene and sanitation conditions, as well as displacement. Against this backdrop,  the proposed activities aim at assisting both IDPs and host communities. Access to clean and safe water is a major area of concern in our intervention areas in Somaliland and Puntland.\nOur proposed activities focus on relieving the distress suffered by affected families, preventing their situation from getting worse and strengthening collective resilience mechanisms. In terms of sectors we will focus on Food Security <(>&<)> Livelihoods (FSL), Water, Sanitation <(>&<)> Hygiene (WASH), Protection (PRO), Multi-Purpose Cash (MPCT) and Accountability (ACC).\nOxfam and partners Candlelight, Havoyoco and KAALO will work in the following regions and districts/locations: Awdal (Baki), Sool (Las Anod, Xudun, Bocaame), Sanaag (Eerigavo), Bari (Bossaso), Mudug (Jariiban).

This has proved successful in the last three years. The strategy engages young women and men from diverse backgrounds to be a driving force for social progress and optimism about the future in their respective countries and across Africa.\nWhen we worked with stakeholders in each country to analyse the current situation faced by young men and women, we found three common key needs:\n1. Improving curricula and training methods, creating new modules and connecting the curricula to the demands of the market.\n2. Innovation to respond to social issues such as climate change, gender rights and urbanization.\n3. Linking service delivery interventions with influencing interventions # young people do not need only better training and new skills, but also changes to the system: policies, laws, practices and the attitudes and beliefs of their fellow citizens, employers and the government.\nThese conclusions have guided this proposal in further developing interventions and adapting activities for each country for 2020-2022. We will highlight new interventions in the following chapters.\nOur strategy is based on systems thinking:trying to understand how different parts of a system interact to effect change, rather than understanding specific components in isolation. Systems thinking can help to develop truly sustainable and transformative change.

                "In 2004 Oxfam Novib set up a Liaison Office in Nairobi, Kenya in order to support the Strengthening Somali Civil Society Program, at the request of the EU. This request was based on Oxfam Novib's work in Somalia to date, but intended to be more widely directed atthe entire civil society sector and the specific context in which it is operating in a post-conflict country. The program started with consulting local organisations in Somalia and Somaliland to get a complete picture of the sectors and regions where they are active, the challenges they face and the relationship between civil society, local political structures and the private sector. A program was then developed to strengthen the institutional development of Oxfam Novib's partners and those of other Oxfams, as well as a range of new NGOs.\nIn the first year local consultants were trained in Somalia. They were then seconded to civil society organisations to build their capacity in financial and organisational management. Furthermore, workshops were organised on specific themes suchas human rights and the role of civil society in the Somali context. The Liaison Office is now going to support the expansion of the program, focussing on strengthening both organisation and project management, while facilitating more training in the fields of civic education, governance, human rights and women's rights, HIV and AIDS and child protection.\nOver the years, the Somalia Country Office has expanded its intervention on short term humanitarian response as well as development development interventions. In 2015/2016, a decision was reached to move the Country Programme operation, which was largely in Nairobi, from Nairobi to Hargeisa. The country office has a small office in Nairobi , Kenya and large operations office in Hargeisa, Somaliland."

Toll-free Covid-19 helplines our partner Shaqodoon is running in the Ministries of Health in Somaliland and Puntland have been launched in mid-April and beginnning of May respectively. The call centres utilize an interactive voice response system providing up to date information related to Covid-19 to the community. People can call the hotline and receive WHO-approved pre-recorded messages on COVID-19, check symptoms, and also talk to a healthofficers if they wish to doso. They can also leave a voicemail and will be called back. The system can be accessed free of charge through mobile phones for callers using a 3-digit shortcode.\n\nThe Somaliland hotline has registered more than 651,366 calls so far (as of 19 May), highlighting the thirst of people across Somaliland for accurate and reliable information on Covid-19.  A number of risk cases have been identified through the helplines already, and people tested as a result of their call and guidance received. Shaqodoon is highlighting common misinformation on Covid-19 gathered through calls as well as stats on calls, follow-up and regional origin of callers on dashboards which support the Ministry of Health and humanitarian partners in addressing needs in a timely manner. They also produce weekly dashboards to provide the Ministry of Health with an overview of calls, levels of (mis-)information per region and necessary follow-up.\n\nThis project would support Shaqodoon in extending the helplineservice in collaboration with the Ministries of Health for another 2 months until June/July, reaching a majority of the population in Puntland and Somaliland (at least 60% of the population) with accurate and timely information, guidance and symptoms checking, while at the same time ensuring call center staff and Ministry of Health officials receive adequate protection and safe programming support to deal with sensitive data and critical cases.  Their work will be accompanied by the installment of innovative hands-free handwashing stations designed and produced in the TVET centres of partner Havoyoco. These measures will reach another 30,000 people across Somaliland.",

It operates as a non-profit making organization that has the right to network with a variety of organizations that share similar values and vision.

We work in the belief that women through their own efforts and in collaboration with local, national and international allies are central to transforming their own lives and the lives of their communities and population of which they are part.
